\chapter{Question 2}
\label{avoiding-uri-aliases} 

\textbf {Take the Twitter graph you generated in question 1 and test for male-female homophily.  For the purposes of this question you can consider the graph as undirected (i.e., no distinction between ``follows'' and ``following'').  Use the twitter name (not ``screen name''; for example ``Michael L. Nelson'' and not ``@phonedude\textunderscore mln'') and programatically determine if the user is male or female.  Some sites that might be useful:}\\

\url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gender-detector/0.0.4}\\
\textbf {Create a table of Twitter users and their likely gender.  List any accounts that can't be determined and remove them from the graph.
}\\
\textbf{Perform the homophily test as described in slides 11-15, Week 7.}\\
\textbf{Does your Twitter graph exhibit gender homophily?}

Following are the steps I have taken to solve the problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item I split the names of each follower into last name, first name and initial. 
\item By considering the first name of each user I found the gender of each follower using genderize API.
\item I updated the JSON data in question 1 by adding gender to each follower.
\newpage
\item The screen shot of updated JSON data is in Figure \ref{fig:q1fig1}

\item The code is listed in Listing \ref{lst:q2code1}.
\newpage
\item This data is taken as input for D3 to generate a graph which differentiates the followers based on gender. All male followers are represented in color `orange', female followers in color `green' and those whose gender is not determined are represented in color `blue'. This graph is illustrated in Fgure \ref{fig:q1fig2}
