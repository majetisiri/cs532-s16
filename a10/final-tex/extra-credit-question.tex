\label{intro}

\textbf{ A 1:1 split for training:test data typically not a good split; 5:1 or even 10:1 is preferable.  We also typically use something called ``10-fold cross validation'' to make sure we spread the training out and don't ``overfit'' on a particular sequence of tranining data.\\\\
Rerun questions 2 and 3, but manually classifying all 100 documents, then using 90 for training and 10 for testing.  Use 10-fold cross validation and generate the table from Q2, but this time with the average of all 10 values.  What was the change, if any, in precision and recall (and thus F-Measure)?}\\


Following are the steps I have taken to solve the problem:
