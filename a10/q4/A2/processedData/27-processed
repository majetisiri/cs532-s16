   How to make it:
   1. Preheat your oven to 375°F. In a medium bowl, combine the corn, red
   onion, tomato, and lime juice. Season to taste and set aside.

   2. In a large pan, heat the oil over medium-high. Cover the chicken in
   aluminum foil and, using the bottom of a heavy skillet or a rolling
   pin, bash the chicken until flattened. Season the chicken on both sides
   with salt, pepper, and smoked paprika, and add the breasts to the pan.
   Sear until browned, about 3 to 6 minutes on each side. Reverse one of
   the chicken breasts for later use. Transfer the two others to a cutting
   board, slice into strips, and return the strips to the pan with the
   chipotle mixture. Adjust the heat to low.

   3. Scoop a hearty portion of the chicken mixture into a tortilla, roll
   it up, and tuck it into a glass baking dish. Repeat until all the
   chicken and tortillas are gone. Top with the corn salsa and cheese.
   Transfer the baking dish to the oven. Bake until the cheese melts,
   about 7 minutes.

   4. While the enchiladas bake, make the avocado cream: In a blender or
   food processor, puree the avocado, lime juice, cilantro, and Greek
   yogurt. Gradually add in the water until creamy (you may not use all
   the water). Season to taste with salt and pepper.

   5. Carefully remove the baking dish from the oven. Top the enchiladas
   with the avocado crema and additional cilantro and adobo sauce, if you
   want. Makes 4 servings.
