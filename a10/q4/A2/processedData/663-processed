If you're a fan of guacamole, but don't like that it's high in fat, then
you're going to go crazy for edamole. The green appearance comes from
edamame, which are high in protein, low in fat and calories, and have a sweet
and fresh flavor that is perfect for warm-weather parties.

Even though guacamole is made with healthy fat, you can have too much of a
good thing. Swap out avocados for edamame, and you've got yourself some
nutritious edamole! This chip dip is full of protein, is low in fat, and most
importantly, tastes good.

Fans of guacamole will love edamole: it's similar to the real thing but is
made from edamame, not avocado. These soybeans are high in protein but low in
fat and calories. (This dip tastes equally good as a sandwich spread.) Image

HEALTHY FOOD #2- This salsa hit the jackpot. I bought everything fresh
instead of canned products and popped it all into the blender. the pro is
that the yield is enough for my family for at least a week. The con, this
salsa is so delicious that it's gone in under a week. I recommend this to
those who love Mexican food.

wrong. It didn't have much taste and I think it isn't worth it to cut the

Serves: makes about 2 cups (8 servings) - serving size ¼ cup Ingredients •1
avocado •1 cup packed parsley and cilantro leaves (combined) •1 jalapeño,
ribs and seeds removed •2 cloves garlic •juice of one lime (or two - get lots
of limey goodness in there!) •½ cup water •½ cup olive oil •1 teaspoon salt
•½ cup pistachios (you can sub other nuts - see notes) Instructions 1.Pulse
all ingredients - except pistachios - in a food processor until incorporated.
2.Add pistachios and pulse until mostly smooth (depends on what consistency
you want). 3.Serve as a dip, spread, or sauce -- or add additional water or
oil to thin the sauce for use as a dressing or a marinade. Notes I did make
this with other types of nuts like walnuts and almonds and it worked just
fine, but the taste wasn't as good IMHO. If you can find shelled pistachios,
it's worth the splurge!

your average petit four, but that's because there are four layers of sour
cream-cheese pound cake with sweet cherry preserves filling.
