Recipes: Chipotle Barbecue Chicken Wings with Cilantro Buttermilk Dressing

   Published January 30, 2016 | By [20]Tom Jackson

   [21]Chipotle Barbecue Chicken Wings

   You know them, you love them and they are king of the game day spread.
   With the big game nearly upon us, it’s time to plan the party food
   menu, and we’d highly recommend you kick up the wing game another notch
   with these chile infused, sweet barbecue chicken wings.

   Usually, the best deal on chicken wings means going home with whole
   wings, and that’s totally fine. You can cook them whole, or separate
   them like we’ve done here.

   Simply work your knife in between where the pieces meet at each joint.
   The bones will guide you on a path through the joint that requires
   cutting through little-to-no bone. If you do take off the end of the
   bone just be sure to discard any small bone fragments, so no one ends
   up chewing on them.

   Love this [25]Briner brining bucket for these tasks. The plastic lid
   that locks into place takes the worry out of trying to keep your meat
   submerged.

   There’s really not much to this very tasty Cilantro Buttermilk
   Dressing. Its flavors mingle really well with the sweet and mild
   spiciness of the wings. Plus, if you have leftovers you can always
   throw it on a salad the next day.

   Chile bump #2 with [30]Cattleman’s Grill Carne Asada Seasoning! This is
   a good time to decide how spicy you like your wings. Go a little
   lighter if you need to feed the masses, or coat them well for a spicier
   finish.

   After the wings get some color, when the internal temperature passes
   150ºF, you can brush on some of the [32]Chile Slinger Chipotle BBQ
   Sauce, for our final touch of chile flavor. Don’t try to do this any
   earlier in the cooking process, as the sugars might scorch and create a
   bitter flavor.

   Chipotle BBQ Chicken Wings with Cilantro Buttermilk Dressing

   Ingredients
     * 5 lb chicken wings
     * [36]Sweetwater Spice Tres Chiles Fajita Bath
     * [37]Cattleman’s Grill 8 Second Ride Carne Asada Seasoning
     * [38]Chile Slinger Chipotle BBQ Sauce
     *
     * For the Cilantro Buttermilk Dressing:
     * 3/4 cup sour cream
     * 1/2 cup buttermilk
     * 6 tbsp mayonnaise
     * 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, minced
     * 1 tbsp fresh lime juice
     * 1 tbsp fresh chives, minced
     * 1 clove garlic, minced
     * Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste
     *

   Instructions

   If using whole wings, cut off the tips and discard, then separate the
   two wing pieces by cutting at joint in the space between where the
   bones meet. Place the wings in a [39]Briner Bucket. Add equal parts
   [40]Sweetwater Spice Tres Chiles Fajita Bath and water to the bucket,
   enough to cover all wings. Lock the plastic plate in place to keep the
   wings submerged. Place in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes.

   While the chicken soaks, combine all ingredients for the Cilantro
   Buttermilk Dressing in a blender. Blend until smooth. Store in the
   refrigerator.

   Preheat your [41]Yoder Smokers YS640 to 425ºF, set up with
   [42]GrillGrates.

   Remove the wings from the liquid. Pat dry with paper towels. Season all
   surfaces with [43]Cattleman’s Grill 8 Second Ride Carne Asada
   Seasoning.

   Grill the wings on both sides to achieve nice browning. Use an
   [44]instant read thermometer to monitor the internal temperature. When
   the wings get to 150ºF, brush the tops with [45]Chile Slinger Chipotle
   BBQ Sauce. Flip and brush the other side. Remove from the cooker when
   the internal temperature reaches 165ºF. Serve hot with the Cilantro
   Buttermilk Dressing for dipping.
