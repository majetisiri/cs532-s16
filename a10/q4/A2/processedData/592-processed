Guy Hunting Random Person Who Took a Dump on The Front Of His $80,000 Tesla

   A Tesla owner was trying to impress his date by showing off his new
   $80,000 Tesla. Unfortunately for the guy, as they returned to the
   vehicle they discovered someone had took a giant dump right on the
   front of the $80,000 car.

   The poor victim revealed:

     ‘I was on a date with a girl, who was very conservative. It was our
     third date and when we walked out, sure enough we saw that someone
     had taken a very large s**t on my windshield…leading me to believe
     that perhaps someone had s**t in a container at home and then threw
     it on my car later.’

   As you can imagine his date was not impressed and was apparently
   traumatized by the whole incident.

   Police officers were apparently very unhelpful and the poor guy was
   left to use a magazine and a bottle of water to remove the matter.

   Not content with just brushing the incident off, the guy kept a sample
   and is now doing his own investigation to find the culprit.

   On a post on Craig’s List the victim went on to add:

     ‘…I will plan on ruling you out with DNA for I have kept a sample of
     the s**t for I can see someone trying to pull another fast one on
     me,’ he added.

     ‘And trust me, that is not going to happen. Taking dumps on a
     person’s car is something children do, not adults. And although from
     time to time, I could see why someone deserves it, this was
     absolutely uncalled for.’

   He is even offering ‘significant compensation’ to anyone who can help
   him solve the crisis.

   Signing off on his post, he wrote –

     ‘Lastly, a message to the person who did this: I will find you. Do
     you understand me? I have already had my lawyer draft up subpoena to
     acquire footage from nearby security cameras amongst other things.

     ‘Personally, I think you need medical attention to do what you have
     done.’

   I wonder if he got another date?
