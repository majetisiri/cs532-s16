Encore! Encore! For a Star Of Summer

By REGINA SCHRAMBLING

Published: June 20, 2001

   CONNOISSEURS know corn bread has a shelf life just slightly longer than
   a soufflé. Hot out of the oven, it reaches perfection in those few
   heartbeats between the moment you get the butter slathered on and the
   second it starts to fall apart as you take the first bite.

   Once corn bread goes cold on you, it's no longer fit to be bread. It
   never reheats well; it just dries out and turns to crumbs. And then it
   starts to get interesting.

   Leftover corn bread is one of the great secret ingredients in summer,
   when it seems there's always corn bread left over, along with the
   excess coleslaw and barbecued chicken. Even at its most forlorn, hours
   or a day old, it still has strong corn flavor and crunchy texture. You
   just can't eat it by the wedge. You have to crush it into crumbs and
   make it into a topping for baked fish, break it up and treat it like
   couscous in a salad or cube it and use it in savory puddings or as a
   stuffing for baked tomatoes or zucchini.

   I started recycling stale corn bread instead of tossing it out many
   summers ago after interviewing a Texas barbecue impresario who called
   himself Crazy Sam Higgins. Along with educating me in the finer points
   of rubs as opposed to sauces and in smoking rather than grilling, he
   passed along a recipe for a corn-bread salad that he swore was so good,
   anyone who made it would be tempted to eat the whole bowlful. An
   ingredient list that started with a full pint of mayonnaise made it
   easy to understand why.

   But it's more than just unflinching richness that makes this salad
   irresistible. It's the contrast of color and crunch in natural
   complements for corn: scallions, celery, bell pepper, pimentos, toasted
   pecans and juicy tomatoes. I bake corn bread just to let it go cold so
   I can eat this dish.

   I've since come across corn-bread salad recipes that call for bacon,
   eggs, cheese, ranch dressing and other overkill ingredients. And I've
   experimented myself, adding Vidalia onions, fresh corn or pickled
   jalapeños. But this is one of those rare recipes you really can't
   improve.

   I had better luck putting my imprint on another corn-bread makeover, a
   pudding from ''Tom Douglas' Seattle Kitchen'' (Morrow, 2000) that had
   been haunting me for months before I decided to try it for a dinner
   party a couple of weeks ago. It called for a chef's extravagance of
   fresh herbs and cheese, but my menu had more of a Southwestern theme
   and two kinds of cheese already. I left out the Monterey Jack, parsley,
   rosemary and thyme, and added sweet red pepper and chipotle chilies in
   smoky adobo sauce. And I didn't know whether to be wounded or flattered
   when there were leftovers of everything but that pudding.

   Both dishes sound and taste very American but have antecedents in
   Europe. Corn-bread salad is just a Texas twist on Tuscan bread salad,
   also a salvage operation for stale bread. And the pudding is a savory
   take on pain perdu (alias French toast), in which stale bread absorbs a
   new identity thanks to eggs and dairy.

   You could make either dish with store-bought corn bread or with the
   oversweetened kind from a mix, but that would be silly. It takes less
   time to make corn bread from scratch than it does for it to go stale.

   CORN BREAD

   Time: 25 minutes

   1 tablespoon plus 1/4 cup peanut or corn oil

   1 cup coarse yellow cornmeal

   1/2 cup flour

   2 tablespoons sugar or honey

   1 teaspoon baking powder

   1 teaspoon baking soda

   1/2 teaspoon salt

   2 eggs

   1 cup buttermilk.

   1. Heat oven to 425 degrees. Use 1 tablespoon oil to grease 9-inch
   square or round pan.

   2. Combine dry ingredients in one bowl, whisk wet ingredients in
   another. Combine and stir together just until batter is moistened but
   not smooth. Spread into pan and bake 15 to 20 minutes, until toothpick
   inserted in center comes out clean. Cool on rack.

   Yield: 8 to 10 servings.

   CHIPOTLE-CORN-BREAD PUDDING

   Time: About 50 minutes

   2 1/2 tablespoons melted butter

   Just under 3 cups stale corn bread in large cubes

   1 large Vidalia or other sweet onion, peeled and thinly sliced

   1 large red sweet pepper, cored, seeded and thinly sliced

   1 teaspoon Mexican oregano

   1 teaspoon coarse sea salt

   2 to 4 chipotle chilies in adobo, chopped, with sauce to taste

   4 large eggs

   1 pint half-and-half

   1/4 cup heavy cream.

   1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease 8-inch baking dish with one-half
   tablespoon melted butter. Arrange corn bread cubes in pan.

   2. Place remaining butter in large sauté pan. Add onion, pepper,
   oregano and salt and cook slowly until very soft and almost
   caramelized, about 20 minutes. Strew over corn bread. In bowl, whisk
   together chipotles, eggs, half and half and cream. Pour over corn bread
   and let stand 10 minutes.

   3. Bake 40 minutes, until set and golden. Serve hot.

   Yield: 6 to 8 servings.

   CORN-BREAD SALAD

   Adapted from ''I'm Glad I Ate When I Did 'Cause I'm Not Hungry Now''

   (Crazy Sam Enterprises, 1984)

   Time: 10 minutes plus chilling

   About 6 cups stale corn bread, crumbled

   1 large green bell pepper, seeded and diced

   1 to 2 large ripe tomatoes, diced

   2 stalks celery, diced

   1 large bunch scallions, trimmed and chopped

   1 2-ounce jar pimentos, drained and chopped

   1 pint mayonnaise

   1/2 cup toasted pecans, chopped

   Salt and fresh black pepper to taste.

   Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix well.

   Chill before serving.

   Yield: 8 servings.
