     Honey Chipotle Meatballs – from Paleo Cupboard Cookbook

   [Honey-Chipotle-Meatballs-2.jpg]
   On the seventh day of Christmas, my true love gave to me… Honey
   Chipotle Meatballs.
   For the next 12 days, in celebration of Christmas (my favorite
   holiday), I am giving away a new cookbook everyday on Instagram. To
   enter the giveaway go to my Instagram, and 1) Tag up to 20 friends 2)
   For each friend that is also following @bravoforpaleo , you will
   receive 1 entry. So the more you tag, the better chance you have to win
   a cookbook! The winner will be announced Christmas Eve.
   More appetizers! Because we all know holidays are filled with parties
   and get togethers, and usually the easiest option is to bring an
   appetizer or dessert. Yesterday I shared Mozzarella Sticks, and today
   I’m sharing the Honey Chipotle Meatballs from The Paleo Cupboard
   Cookbook.
   Let’s talk about The Paleo Cupboard Cookbook. Here’s what I love about
   it. 1) There are 140 PALEO RECIPES! And they are neatly organized in
   the back of the book with pictures included. 2) There’s a 4 week meal
   plan in the front of the book, with a shopping list for each week. 3)
   There are kitchen tips with most of the recipes, which teach you how to
   make-ahead recipes or freeze them. So helpful!

   I’ve always been a fan of Amy Desmore’s blog, Paleo Cupboard. I love
   how her recipes are do-able, explained well, and useful in weekly
   cooking. The book is filled with just what it says, “real food, real
   flavor”.
