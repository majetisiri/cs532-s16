   1. Food Safety may be the next big challenge being addressed by top
   entrepreneurs.
   Amina Elahi of the Chicago Tribune reports that following debacles like
   the [5]Chipotle food contamination crisis, consumers are pushing for
   information on the origins of the food they eat now more than ever
   before.
   [6] "Organic, Local, Sustainable, but can startups make sure food is
   safe?"

   2. Organic Corn one of dominant food trends in 2015, analysts say:
   Food and beverage analysts at NPD Group reported earlier this week that
   corn, organic maize to be specific, saw significant uptick in demand in
   2015. This trend is indicative of [7]a greater movement toward healthy
   eating by the general public, which is expected to continue in 2016.

   Food contamination at fast-food giant Chipotle will only intensify
   consumer demand for more information on the safety, health, and origin
   of their food.

   Organic corn based products are gaining popularity among U.S. consumers
   in 2016

   3. Madison, Wisconsin an emerging hub for early stage food startups?
   It could be so. Startups like [9]EnvoyNow and [10]Mr. Delivery have all
   either launched in Madison or selected the city as an early expansion
   location.
   Among these startups, food delivery is one of the most popular niches.
   Why? Over [11]80% of food deliveries in the U.S. are still made
   offline.
