   New Entrants Stay Afloat as Dalal Street Sinks Deep - Investors Europe
   Asia | Global Asia Trader | Scoop.it
   From [344]snip.ly - [345]Today, 1:06 AM

     A number of new entrants to the stock market this fiscal year have
     managed to stay above their IPO levels, even as some big names like
     Coffee Day Enterprises and InterGlobe Aviation have fallen sharply
     from their peaks.

   Kneenita's insight:

   "Actually this is the sector which is influencing the share prices.
   Most of these firms are in the healthcare business, in which investors
   have high expectations given their future growth prospects. As a result
   the shares remain unaffected to the volatility," Geojit BNP Paribas
   head-fundamental research Vinod Nair said.

     World equities descended into a bear market, as an afternoon
