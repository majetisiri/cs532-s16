   A Chicago man who goes by "Michael" took to Craigslist to air his
   grievances

   Now Iʼm no Tesla owner. But say I were a Tesla owner? Youʼre darn
   tootinʼ I wouldnʼt appreciate it if someone took a steamy hot dump all
   over my clean windshield. Unfortunately, thatʼs what apparently
   happened to this poor Chicago guy named "Michael" who took to
   [20]Craigslist to kvetch about a very inconspicuous poop someone had
   left on the windshield of his nice Model X. And now heʼs out for
   VENGEANCE.

   [21]Letʼs just pretend this is real, k?

     Obviously I have a large degree of humility when writing this
     because I am seeking people out here to see if anyone has any
     information about who may have taken a gigantic shit on the
     windshield of my brand new Tesla Model X.

   This has to be a joke.

     This is not a joke.

   Very dope, thank you for clarifying that. "Michael" goes on:

     Now I know a lot of people might find this funny but my date was
     really traumatized by the whole thing and I have zero leads. Whatʼs
     more, the CPD "absolutely refused" to help me, a tax paying citizen,
     clean the shit off of my car. But they obviously didnʼt hesitate to
     tell me I could not drive with the poop on my windshield because it
     would obstruct my visibility. I had to use a redeye magazine and
     bottle of water to clean it off and that sucked.

   Imagine the obituary. (Cause of death: too much poop on windshield,
   couldnʼt see.)

   "Michael" concludes his note with a threat ("I will find you") and that
   the poop-layinʼ perp better lawyer the hell up, because "taking dumps
   on a personʼs car is something children do, not adults." Hell hath no
   fury like a Tesla owner wrapping up a date only to find adult poops all
   over his electric vehicle.
