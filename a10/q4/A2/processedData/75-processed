Vegetarian Chipotle Tofu, Plantain, and Refried Bean Tortas

   Vegetarian chipotle tofu, plantain, and refried bean tortas: upping the
   veggie sandwich game one bite at a time.
   [11]Vegetarian Chipotle Tofu, Plantain, and Refried Bean Tortas

   All it takes is one trip to your local deli to know that the vegetarian
   sandwich market is desperate at best. Whoever thought that throwing
   undressed raw veggies between two slices of bread without even a hint
   of seasoning (or even salt!) was a good idea…WHY?!?!? Also, we’re
   fighting.

   Veggie sandwiches have way more potential than that if you ask me, and
   I’m here to prove it with these chipotle tofu, plantain, and refried
   bean tortas! Absolutely bursting with flavor, these are THE sandwich
   that you need in your life, whether you’re trying to find a vegetarian
   ‘wich for your upcoming Superbowl party or just trying to figure out
   what to make for lunch.

   [12]Vegetarian Chipotle Tofu, Plantain, and Refried Bean Tortas

   A torta is a traditional Mexican sandwich that is typically stuffed
   with lots of meat and garnished with tomatoes, jalapenos, avocado, and
   onion. It is considered to be “street food” and is frequently served at
   mass events like football matches, parades, and outdoor concerts.

   With these, I’ve kept the big, bold Mexican flavor profile but replaced
   the animal protein with refried beans, fried plantains, and
   Nasoya [13]Chipotle TofuBaked! The Nasoya [14]Chipotle TofuBaked
   requires just a few minutes on the stove to heat it through, but
   otherwise it is already cooked and seasoned to spicy perfection. The
   fried plantains also come together quickly, making these sandwiches
   perfect for when you want to feed lots of people with minimal effort.

   While you can finish off the sandwiches with any toppings you want, I
   chose to garnish them with quick pickled onion slices, cilantro, and a
   garlicky mojo sauce, though pickled jalapenos, hot sauce, and queso
   fresco would also be great here.

       I agree that most vegetarian sandwiches are boring. This looks
       wonderful and full of flavor. I want to try that tofu. Never had
       that one before. Love that it is already spiced up!

       I love a good veggie sandwich – pile on the goodness! I’m not a
       huge tofu fan, but I’m intrigued by the fried plantains.

       I love me some tortas! And I agree, even as a meat eater I enjoy a
       good veggie sandwich sometimes but it’s hard to find good ones! But
       I think this one is a winner.

       But then you make awesome vegetarian sandwiches…and they’re the
       first to go at a party. Spice is everything. That color, girl!!
       These are gorgeous.

       OH MY DAYS those look amazing!! The idea of having plantains in the
       sandwich is just genius! Also, I’m a fan of anything and everything
       that has beans, so I feel like you made this recipe with me in mind
       haha =)

       I don’t like the sound of that vegetable sandwich with no dressing
       or seasoning. I do love the look of your Mexican sandwich. We don’t
       see plantains all that often around here; I must look out for them.
       I hope the pregnancy is progressing well xx

       Love these tortas! At summer camp growing up I always had an issue
       on many dinner nights, so I would have plantain sandwiches – no,
       seriously! These hit home for me, except they are way fancier and
       much better tasting no doubt!

       “Absolutely bursting with flavor” sounds right! I’ve made tortas
       with refried beans, green chile, and cheese, but never tofu and
       platains, fried platains at that. YUM! I’ll be giving these a try
       for sure!
