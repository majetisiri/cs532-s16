Culinary News: Chipotle In The Clear

   by [44]Rebecca Chodorkoff | [45]Dish + Drink | Feb 5, 2016

   After months of unfortunate press overshadowing the casual Mexican
   chain, it seems that Chipotle's troubles may finally be over.
   The Center For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced that
   the outbreak of E. Coli, which has plagued Chipotle for months, has
   finally been [46]deemed eradicated. After a series of outbreaks the
   chain was forced to close multiple storefronts, and reassess its
   protocol for preparing and serving food.
   With an investigation complete, Chipotle has a go-ahead to keep on
   cooking, and customers have the peace of mind of being able to return
   to their favorite restaurant.
   No specific ingredient was able to be identified as the source of the
   outbreak.
   Having operated with a relative amount of transparency and humility
   throughout this process, Chipotle has managed to maintain clear
   communication with its customers--and despite the scandal, they do not
   appear to have lost an inordinate amount of patrons in the process.
   The previously scheduled [47]one-day shut down of all storefronts on
   February 8th will still take place, so that Chipotle can make sure to
   get all of their ducks in a row.
