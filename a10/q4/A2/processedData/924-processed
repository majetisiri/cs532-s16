   WHY BUY A USED CAR FROM USED-CARS.CO.ZA?

   Buying a used car or bakkie from Used-Cars.co.za can save you money
   because any new car depreciates in value by as much as 40 percent
   within the first 12 to 18 months of its life. Rather than watching
   value of a new car decrease significantly in the first year, consider
   buying a used car or bakkie from Used-Cars.co.za. A used car has the
   benefits of a lower purchase price with lower monthly payments, and in
   some cases the balance of the manufacturersâ€™ factory warranties are
   still available. Consider the following:


   RELIABILITY OF A USED CAR FROM USED-CARS.CO.ZA

   One thing that has made used cars more appealing is their improved
   reliability. Rust and exhaust-system problems were common problems in
   used cars years ago, but thatâ€™s no longer the case, and major engine
   and transmission problems have also decreased, making late-model used
   vehicles far less of a risk to buy. Provided a car is properly
   maintained, todayâ€™s vehicles should easily surpass 100,000 kilometres
   without a major overhaul. .


   BUY A USED CAR AT USED-CARS.CO.ZA

   With the most trusted inventory of used cars on the internet,
   Used-Cars.co.za is constantly striving to offer more used cars listings
   to help you find the used car of your dreams. We are a dealer to
   consumer used car website. We invite you to browse through over 10,000
   listings with photos, prices and detailed vehicle information.


   EXTENDED WARRANTIES AND REPAIRS.

   Although pre-owned cars are more reliable than ever, maintenance and
   repair costs are important considerations. In the first two or three
   years of a carâ€™s life it has fewer problems and dependent on the
   kilometres covered could still be covered by a factory warranty. A used
   car that is a few years old is usually out of warranty or close to it.
   You can expect not only more problems as time goes on, but more costly
   ones as the years and kilometres increase.


   REDUCE THE RISK

   One can reduce the risk on a used car from Used-Cars.co.za by taking
   out an extended warranty which is effectively an insurance policy in
   the event of major breakdowns. This also means the vehicle has to be
   serviced at prescribed intervals in order for the warranty to be
   honoured. In addition to this, as an owner will have to pay for
   services, including â€˜wear & tearâ€™ on parts like tires, brakes and
   replacement batteries. But even if you replaced all those things the
   moment you bought a used car, the savings over a new car would more
   than compensate. There is always the risk with whatever you buy. Even a
   car with a great reliability and a full service history can be a poor
   example, or has been abused, neglected, or damaged by the previous
   owner. You need to have the vehicle thoroughly inspected by a qualified
   mechanic, or better still, by the AA in order to protect yourself
   against nasty surprises. You donâ€™t have to be a member of the AA to
   use their services. AA Members qualify for a 15% discount on Roadworthy
   Tests and Technical Inspections if they visit a DEKRA Centre and
   produce their AA Membership card. DEKRA has taken over the ownership
   and management of the formerly branded AA Test and Drive Centres and
   have now branded the centres "DEKRA in association with the AA". The
   collaboration between the AA and DEKRA will ensure that the standards
   of vehicle safety in South Africa are world class. The DEKRA in
   association with the AA centres offer a range of professional vehicle
   examinations designed to help you identify vehicle flaws, and make an
   informed decision when purchasing a new or used car.


   USED CAR VS NEW CAR DEPRECIATION IN VALUE

   A major disadvantage of buying a new car is its rapid depreciation.
   Models typically lose close to 50 percent of their value in the first
   three years, compared with 24 percent over the next three. But this
   varies greatly among models. Several factors determine depreciation,
   including the modelâ€™s popularity, perceived quality, supply, and
   whether or not the vehicle belongs to the current design generation.


   INSURANCE

   Youâ€™ll typically pay a bit less to insure a used vehicle than a new
   version of the same model


   SAFETY FEATURES

   Buying a used car means you might not get the very latest safety
   features. Features such as electronic stability control (ESC),
   head-protecting curtain air bags, and advanced frontal air bag systems
   are hard to find on older vehicles. But safety features such as
   anti-lock brakes, traction control, and side air bags have been
   commonplace for a number of years now.


   HOW MUCH CAN YOU AFFORD TO SPEND?

   You have to be realistic before you decide on your dream car. You might
   be dreaming of a new model that has caught your eye or of new features
   that will make your driving more pleasurable. And the first step in
   buying a new car should be to know what price range you can afford. To
   do this, you need two pieces of information:


   DEPOSIT

   A down payment or deposit. How much can you afford with your old car as
   a trade-in, or both?


   MONTHLY PAYMENT

   What is the maximum car payment you can afford every month? Before
   looking searching for a used cars on Used-Cars.co.za decide what your
   monthly budget can afford. A good rule of the thumb is that total
   monthly car repayments shouldn't exceed 20% of your salary (after tax).
   While it may be possible to obtain a loan that requires a minimal down
   payment/deposit (such as 10 percent), it is best to put down as much as
   you can afford-preferably at least 20 percent-to minimise your overall
   cost for the loan. A higher down payment reduces the amount of money
   you need to borrow, which lowers your monthly payments and reduces the
   amount of interest youâ€™ll pay overall. A down payment doesnâ€™t have
   to be all cash. If you already have a car, any trade-in allowance the
   dealer gives you for it can be credited toward your down payment. Or
   you can sell it yourself, which will typically get you more money than
   trading it in. But you may need to do it before you buy your car.


   PRE-APPROVED FINANCE

   It would be to your overall advantage to contact you bank for a
   â€˜pre-approved loanâ€™. With pre-approval you can search for a used
   car on Used-Cars.co.za with confidence.


   CONSIDER YOUR REQUIREMENTS

   Your needs may vary dramatically, but consider the following important
   factors:

     Take the time to have a look at other car brands besides the car
   brand you are driving. Itâ€™s possible another brand might provide
   similar/same features and better suit your financial or family needs.

     The value of used cars are based on their condition, kilometres
   travelled, their popularity and availability.

     Certain used cars are extremely popular and are sold almost
   immediately and sometimes at a premium price.

     Good used cars are readily available offering a wide choice and
   closely meet your needs.

     Visit Used-Cars.co.za and prepare a short-list of cars you could buy.

     In your research process also find news and articles on the brand or
   models that interest you.

     Also compare new car prices with your used car selection by visiting
   our New Car Section.

     From your short-list, complete the enquiry and arrange â€˜test
   drivesâ€™.

     If buying from a private seller be extra vigilant and ensure that you
   meet the seller in a safe location.
