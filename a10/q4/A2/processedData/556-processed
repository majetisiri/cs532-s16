What Chipotle will likely review with staff today

   Chipotle

   All [44]2,000 Chipotle restaurants in the United States are scheduled
   to close for lunch today so management can familiarize the entire staff
   with plans to right the chain after [45]last month’s 36 percent decline
   in same-store sales. Officials haven’t revealed the substance of what
   they’ll say via webcast, but they have shared details about changes in
   policies and procedures, suggesting the topics that will be discussed.

   Those adjustments will range from new compensation packages to prep
   adjustments intended to avert food safety crises like the E.coli and
   norovirus outbreaks that sickened customers in late 2015.

   Here are some of the matters likely to be addressed on Monday, some in
   the general session, and some just with store managers.

New compensation incentives

   Going forward, half of managers’ bonuses will be based on how their
   restaurants are scored by outside sanitation experts during quarterly
   audits. The other half will be determined by the managers’ efforts to
   draw customers back into the stores, co-CEO Monty Moran said in a call
   with financial analysts this week. He did not elaborate on how
   management will be expected to boost traffic, other than mentioning an
   emphasis on service.

Near-constant safety audits

   In addition to the quarterly sanitation audits by third parties, weekly
   inspections of every restaurant in the system will be conducted by
   field leaders, Chipotle’s version of regional directors. “We are taking
   this expanded auditing program very seriously and changing incentives
   for managers and field leaders accordingly,” said Moran.

Recipe tweaks

   The chopped onions, jalapenos and cilantro used in the chain’s salsa
   and guacamole will be marinated in lime juice before being blended into
   the dishes. “This process brings out more flavor from these ingredients
   and adds another measure of food safety,” said co-CEO Steve Ells.

New marketing

   The staff will likely be given a sneak preview of Chipotle’s new ad
   campaign, “the largest in company history,” according to Chief Creative
   and Development Officer Mark Crumpacker. New messages will be delivered
   through billboards, TV commercials, print spots, radio ads and digital
   materials through June. “The creative for this campaign with one small
   exception does not mention food safety or the recent incidents,” said
   Crumpacker. “Instead, it reinforces our commitment to high-quality
   ingredients and great-tasting food.”

New prep processes

   Tomatoes, lettuce and bell peppers will be washed, cut and otherwise
   prepped in commissaries. Avocados, citrus fruits, onions and jalapenos
   will be blanched in the restaurants as a “kill stage” to eradicate
   pathogens. Chicken and steak will be marinated in a different process,
   and completely apart from the prep of other ingredients, lessening the
   chances of cross-contamination.

A new website for the public

   Chipotle will launch a new website on Monday that details all the food
   safety upgrades the chain is undertaking. The site is intended as a
   resource for concerned consumers.

New training

   Crew training will be intensified to make every worker aware of food
   safety protocols, Ells said.

   None of the additional safeguards is a magic bullet, he told investors.
   But as redundant safety measures, he continued, they should elevate the
   perceived and actual safety of Chipotle’s food to a new industry
   standard.

   The stores are scheduled to reopen at 3 p.m. in their respective time
   zones.
