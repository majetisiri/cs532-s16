[7]Long-Lost Nikola Tesla Drawings Reveal Genius Map For Multiplication

   Published on Monday, 28 December 2015 11:20 | [8]Print | Hits: 3658

   As of late researchers found arrangements of unique Nikola Tesla
   drawings that uncovers a guide to increase that contains all numbers in
   an easy to utilize framework. The drawings were found at a relic shop
   in focal Phoenix Arizona by neighborhood craftsman, Abe Zucca. They are
   accepted to have been the aspiration in most recent years of Tesla’s
   Free Energy lab, Wardenclyffe. The composition is thought to contain
   numerous answers for unanswered inquiries regarding math.

   The Sketches were covered up in a little trunk with various different
   drawings and original copies going from hand-held innovative gadgets to
   free-vitality frameworks, numerous with notes scribbled all over them.
   A portion of the pieces are as of now commonplace to the general
   population, however, a couple of others are definitely not in the
   public. The best is the Map to Multiplication or the Math Spiral. Zucca
   made a couple duplicates and demonstrated the drawings around to
   distinctive masterminds, visionaries, and mathematicians.

   A couple of days after the fact a Local High School Mathematics
   Instructor, Joey Grether, had been chipping away at disentangling the
   framework and had a couple of leaps forward. Grether proposes that the
   Spiral investigates Multiplication as an intertwined web, as well as
   that it, “offers a comprehensive visual understanding of how all
   numbers are self-organized into 12 positions of composability.”

   “This device allows us to see numbers as patterns, the formation of
   prime numbers, twin primes, Highly composite numbers, multiplication
   and division, as well as few other systems, I imagine, that are yet to
   be discovered.”

   The diagram itself is very intuitive, allowing students to see how
   numbers all work together based on a spiral with 12 positions. 12, or
   12x (multiples of 12) is the most highly composite system, which is why
   we have 12 months in a year, 12 inches in a foot, 24 hours in a day,
   etc. 12 can be divided by 2, 3, 4, and 6. So can all multiples of 12.
   For every 12 numbers, there is a chance of 4 numbers being prime. They
   happen to fall in positions (think clock positions) 5, 7, 11, and 1.

   Tesla is known for the quote “If you only knew the magnificence of the
   3, 6 and 9, then you would have the key to the universe.” It turns out
   that when the device is examined, the digital roots of the numbers in
   positions 3, 6, 9, and 12 constantly repeat the same sequence 3, 6, 9!
   Is this what Tesla was referring too? The self-organization of numbers
   and their digital roots?

   It’s hard to say, but Grether seems to think so. “This breakthrough is
   phenomenal. If we could get students all over the globe to use this
   technique, to play with it, and help figure out how to use it, we could
   overcome our cultural aversion to Mathematics. Instead of memorizing
   the multiplication table, we could learn the positions of numbers and
   have a better understanding of how they work.”

   Juan Zapata, One of Mr. G’s students believes so as well… “I used to
   say I’m bad at Math… because that’s what everyone says, but now, I’m
   like, dude, this is too easy.”

   There’s one other fact about the Tesla Spiral that make it interesting.
   The diagram is dated 12/12/12! 1912. Grether and his students want to
   turn December 12 into a national holiday. So grab a 12 pack, get a
   dozen donuts, and celebrate the power of 12x [via cbsnews.com.co].
