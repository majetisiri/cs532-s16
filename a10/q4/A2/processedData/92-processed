     Honey Chipotle Ribs

   [ribs-36.jpg]
   I participated in the National Pork Board Program as a member of
   One2One Network. I received compensation but all opinions are mine.

   Instagram and Giveaway (worth $150) information below.
   These tender Honey Chipotle Ribs are grilled until they develop a
   wonderful char and are both sweet and spicy. Whether you’re celebrating
   Dad’s Day by grilling up tasty pork burgers and ribs this June or
   hosting a backyard BBQ to kick-off the first day of summer, pork has
   you covered – no matter what grilling holiday is marked on your
   calendar. With so many cuts and preparation methods to try and endless
   flavor combinations to explore, pork is the must-have this grilling
   season.


   There?s no need to be intimidated by cooking ribs. They?re really quite

   This method insures they are tender plus you don?t have to spend hours
   hovering over the hot grill for several hours waiting for them to cook.


   Even better, the oven part of the recipe can be done one day and then
   they can be finished on the grill the next day.

   I used Smithfield St. Louis Style Ribs and just a few simple
   ingredients for this recipe. This Father’s Day, Walmart is the ultimate
   source for your barbecue essentials and great pork deals on your
   grilling favorites like ribs. Look for these pork favorite when
   shopping the meat case and visit GrillPork.org for more grilling
   inspiration. While serving up your pork dishes this grilling season, be
   sure to pick-up Smithfield/Farmland [depending on market] ribs at
   Walmart; every cut of their hand-trimmed extra tender fresh pork is
   proudly raised in the USA.


   The ribs are first coated with honey and then sprinkled with a chipotle
   chili based rub. I love the flavor of chipotle chili powder. It has
   much more heat than regular chili powder. You could use regular...
