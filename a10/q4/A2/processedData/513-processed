   [33]Health Ranger: Let's end the era of government suppression of

CDC investigation of Chipotle further supports corporate sabotage
(bioterrorism) as likely source of E. coli contamination

   Chipotle
   (NaturalNews) After months of investigation, the CDC has now reached a
   conclusion that provides yet more support for the likelihood that
   Chipotle was the victim of corporate sabotage by the biotech industry,
   which targeted Chipotle because of its non-GMO menu.
   On December 23 of last year, I [38]wrote about the likelihood of
   bioterrorism as the cause of Chipotle's E. coli problem, pointing out
   that corporate sabotage was 100% consistent with the actions of the
   biotech industry and its criminal-minded "mafia" of operatives (see
   [39]MonsantoMafia.com for a list of all the "mafia" members). That
   article was predictably downplayed by the mainstream media, whose
   journalists remain absolutely clueless about the death threats,
   censorship, defamation and other dirty tactics routinely used by
   biotech industry shills to silence opposition.
   But now the CDC has reached a conclusion in its investigation of
   Chipotle that further supports my original contention. "The E. coli
   outbreaks at Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants in the United States
   appear to be over, but investigators have been unable to trace the
   cause of the sickness, federal authorities said on Monday," reports
   [40]The New York Times. "[I]nvestigators were unable to specify the
   food or ingredient responsible for the contamination."

Even the CDC could not narrow down E. coli to an ingredient source

   To investigate the E. coli problem, the CDC investigated each food
   ingredient and each food source in order to try to find one common
   cause for the E. coli contamination. But all their tests turned up
   negative. The stunning upshot of this is that E. coli wasn't found in
   any food source from a supplier.
   Why wasn't it found in any particular food source? The answer is
   simple: because E. coli didn't come from the food materials. It was
   sprayed onto the foods by bioterrorists working for the biotech
   industry who targeted Chipotle restaurants.
   This also explains why the strain of E. coli was different from the
   strain usually found in foods. The most likely explanation is that in
   planning their corporate sabotage, the biotech bioterrorists derived
   their E. coli from an animal source far from any farm fields, then
   found a simple mechanism for nebulizing it (spraying it) on Chipotle
   food materials at targeted Chipotle restaurants. I'm not going to offer
   any details on how this could be accomplished (I don't want to give
   food terrorists any ideas), but I assure you it's a very simple matter
   to accomplish due to the way Chipotle has the fresh food ingredients
   placed adjacent to the customer line (so that customers can see their
   foods are being made fresh).
   Because E. coli was introduced to the Chipotle foods through an act of
   bioterrorism and not a farm source, the CDC was entirely unable to
   trace it to any particular ingredient or supplier. The NYT headline
   says it all: "C.D.C. Unable to Trace Cause of Outbreaks at Chipotle."

Chipotle very likely increasing its own operational security

   It is my contention that we have just witnessed America's first act of
   corporate bioterrorism in the food wars. This fact may never be
   confirmed with absolute certainty, but now the CDC's own investigation
   provides further support of this being the most likely explanation.
   I'd imagine that Chipotle executives are privately taking this
   possibility very seriously, even if they cannot publicly confirm such
   consideration. They already know they've been targeted by the
   vindictive biotech industry, which tried to defame Chipotle with its
   "Chubby Chipotle" campaign that ridiculously claimed that eating fresh
   food ingredients would make you fat.
   Watch for signs of Chipotle boosting its own operational security
   because of all this. This will likely be reflected in the company's
   screening and training of its own employees as well as increased video
   surveillance over its food serving stations.

Why the biotech industry is trying to destroy ethical food companies like
Chipotle

   Chipotle is an ethical company with a pioneering vision of what clean
   fast food should look like. As such, Chipotle is an industry disruptor
   that threatens the waning dominance of the factory-processed,
   chemically formulated food giants like McDonald's and KFC. The GMO
   agri-giants that produce the low-grade ingredients sourced by
   McDonald's and other fast food giants aren't happy about Chipotle
   disrupting their "poison for profit" business model, and they've
   decided to play nasty (which is how the biotech industry operates by
   default).
   This means we probably haven't seen the last of corporate-sponsored
   bioterrorism in America. Watch for more malicious attacks on ethical
   food companies by the biotech industry, a nefarious cabal of truly evil
   corporations run by criminal-minded deceivers who have made it their
   mission to destroy healthy food companies that avoid GMOs.

   [Health-Ranger-BW-author.jpg] About the author:Mike Adams (aka the
   "[66]Health Ranger") is the founding editor of NaturalNews.com, the
   internet's No. 1 natural health news website, now reaching 7 million
   unique readers a month.
   In late 2013, Adams launched the [67]Natural News Forensic Food Lab,
   where he conducts atomic spectroscopy research into food contaminants
   using [68]high-end ICP-MS instrumentation. With this research, Adams
   has made numerous food safety breakthroughs such as revealing rice
   protein products imported from Asia to be [69]contaminated with toxic
   heavy metals like lead, cadmium and tungsten. Adams was the first food
   science researcher to document [70]high levels of tungsten in
   superfoods. He also discovered [71]over 11 ppm lead in imported
   mangosteen powder, and led an [72]industry-wide voluntary agreement to
   limit heavy metals in rice protein products to low levels by July 1,
   2015.
   In addition to his lab work, Adams is also the (non-paid) executive
   director of the non-profit [73]Consumer Wellness Center (CWC), an
   organization that redirects 100% of its donations receipts to grant
   programs that teach children and women how to grow their own food or
   vastly improve their nutrition. [74]Click here to see some of the CWC
   success stories.
   With a background in science and software technology, Adams is the
   original founder of [75]the email newsletter technology company known
   as Arial Software. Using his technical experience combined with his
   love for natural health, Adams developed and deployed the content
   management system currently driving NaturalNews.com. He also engineered
   the high-level statistical algorithms that power
   [76]SCIENCE.naturalnews.com, a massive research resource now featuring
   over 10 million scientific studies.
   Adams is well known for his incredibly popular [77]consumer activism
   video blowing the lid on fake blueberries used throughout the food
   supply. He has also exposed [78]"strange fibers" found in Chicken
   McNuggets, [79]fake academic credentials of so-called health "gurus,"
   dangerous [80]"detox" products imported as battery acid and sold for
   oral consumption, [81]fake acai berry scams, the California [82]raw
   milk raids, the [83]vaccine research fraud revealed by industry
   whistleblowers and many other topics.
   Adams has also helped [84]defend the rights of home gardeners and
   protect the [85]medical freedom rights of parents. Adams is widely
   recognized to have made a remarkable global impact on issues like GMOs,
   vaccines, nutrition therapies, human consciousness.
   In addition to his activism, Adams is an accomplished musician who has
   released [86]ten popular songs covering a variety of activism topics.
