Chipotle Reportedly Believes Its E. Coli Outbreak Came From Australian Beef

   But the CDC thinks produce was the culprit.

   Chipotle's E. coli scare has been [24]declared over, but still no one
   knows where the dangerous bacteria that landed 21 people in the
   hospital came from. Or at least, that's the official word from the
   Centers for Disease Control, the agency that led the investigation into
   the foodborne illness outbreak. But [25]according to a report published
   last night by the Wall Street Journal, the burrito chain believes "the
   E. coli was most likely from contaminated Australian beef," and that
   the bacteria "spread to other ingredients through improper food
   handling."

   by [28]Daniela Galarza

   The WSJ attributes this information to "people familiar with Chipotle."
   Importing grass-fed Australian beef was a relatively new practice for
   the company, having just begun in 2014 (and [29]much to the chagrin of
   American beef producers).

   While the CDC's official conclusion was that the outbreak source was
   unknown, many — including the government agency itself, says the
   Journal — believe it likely stemmed from contaminated produce. Produce
   such as spinach, sprouts, and lettuce have been responsible for [30]a
   number of E. coli outbreaks in the U.S. in recent years,
   including [31]a 2006 outbreak linked to spinach that killed three
   people.

   The report offers further insight into how Chipotle allegedly came to
   such a conclusion:

     When the CDC on Nov. 20 reported the outbreak had spread to
     Minnesota, California, New York and Ohio, Chipotle's distribution
     records convinced the company the culprit was red onions, cilantro
     or beef, said people familiar with its investigation. Onions seemed
     unlikely to Chipotle, because its supplier shipped much of its
     harvest to other restaurants, but no illnesses tied to them had been
     reported.

     Two weeks later, the CDC reported cases in Illinois, Maryland and
     Pennsylvania. Chipotle crossed cilantro off the list, because it
     used a different cilantro supplier in Illinois. That left beef. As
     not all sickened customers ate beef, it could have caused the
     outbreak only if E. coli bacteria passed from the meat to other
     ingredients through improper food handling.

   But as the story notes, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service
   (FSIS) does not believe beef could have been the culprit: "Distribution
   data shared by Chipotle does not establish a link between Australian
   beef, or any single source of beef, and the Chipotle restaurants where
   case patients reported consuming steak," the agency is quoted as
   saying.

   Reached for comment by Eater, Chipotle spokesperson Chris Arnold would
   say only, "The investigation is over and no cause was determined."

   On Tuesday, [32]the company's first quarterly earnings call since the
   outbreaks began revealed that January's same-store sales were down a
   whopping 36 percent from last year, and that an estimated 60 percent of
   Chipotle's most loyal, longtime customers were actively avoiding the
   chain. Its turnaround plan includes stricter food safety protocols and
   a $50 million marketing campaign — but despite its recent troubles, the
   company will forge ahead with opening new locations this year.
