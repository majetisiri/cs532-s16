   [141]/r/technology is a place to share and discuss the latest
   developments, happenings and curiosities in the world of technology; a
   broad spectrum of conversation as to the innovations, aspirations,
   applications and machinations that define our age and shape our future.

Rules:

1. Submissions

     * Guidelines:
     * Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to
       technology
     * Self posts must contribute positively to [142]/r/technology and
       foster reasonable discussion.
     * Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently
       within the context of technology in that they either view the
       events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions
       in the technological world.
     * Please do not submit the following:
     * i) Submissions violating the guidelines.
     * ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and
       video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the
       media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at
       the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions video in the
       URL, it's not suitable.
     * iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to
       [143]/r/techsupport, [144]/r/AskTechnology, another relevant
       community or our weekly Support Saturday threads.
     * iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding - submissions of this nature
       will be removed.
     * v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be
       submitted to [145]/r/TechnologyTalk, or [146]messaged to the
       moderators of the subreddit.
     * vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer
       support.
     * vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly
       submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.

2. Behaviour

     * Remember the human You are advised to abide by [147]reddiquette; it
       will be enforced when user behavior is no longer deemed to be
       suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks,
       abusive language, trolling or bigotry in any form are therefore not
       allowed and will be removed.

3. Titles

     * Submissions must use either the articles title, or a suitable
       quote, either of which must:
     * adequately describe the content
     * adequately describe the content's relation to technology
     * be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning.

4. Flair

     * Please flair your submission appropriately. [148]An extended guide
       to flairing can be found here, in the wiki.

5. Reddit-wide rules.

     * [149]All reddit-wide rules apply here. Do not post personal
       information; no facebook or social media links. Do not [150]spam.
     __________________________________________________________________

Miscellanea

     * If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and

     * Want to host an AMA? Please [152]message the moderators.
     * Our [153]/u/AutoModerator configuration may be viewed [154]here.
     * Removed threads will either be given a removal reason flair or
       comment response; please message the moderators if this did not
       occur.
     * All legitimate, answerable modmail inquiries or suggestions will be
       answered to the best of our abilities within a reasonable period of
       time.
     * Rule violators will be warned. Repeat offenders will be temporarily

       result in a permanent ban. This may be reversed upon evidence of
       suitable behavior.

   Interestingly, FM radio was initially successful because it was less
   susceptible to the interference from combustion engines. (The spark
   plug discharge creates a lot of RF impulse noise.)

   All of the highway information broadcasts— the short-range
   announcements of road closures and things that you get in sparsely
   populated areas— in my area are on AM though. And many stretches of
   road are without cell coverage.

   The frequency range used for AM requires much less power than FM to
   reach farther locations though as you mention AM is much more affected
   by noise than FM.

   Does this also mean that if I am next to a Tesla in traffic it will
   affect MY AM radio reception?

   I can't imagine any of the clear-channel AM stations in particular are
   happy about any of this.

   Probably, we have a noisy power supply in the sound board at my auto
   parts store and it affects the radio reception (even FM) of the cars
   parked directly out front, the radios in the soundboard it's self
   struggle to pick up the strongest local station clearly, it's not a

   I wonder what the levels are. They could actually be high enough to
   make those vehicles illegal to use in the UK because they'd be
   committing an offence under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, especially if
   the interference was on frequencies which require a license and/or
   interfere with others. Just because you're not using a radio to wipe
   out a signal on a frequency doesn't make you immune from committing an
   offence under the Wireless Telegraphy Act.

   Anyone interested in technology enough to buy an electric car is
   knowledgeable enough to know that AM radio is absolute dog shit and
   unnecessary with all of the streaming options.

   AM radio is important though, it's how emergency broadcasts and
   weather/road condition updates are given in many parts of the country.
   Streaming is cool until you realize that it requires powered cell
   towers to operate. Something which is not guaranteed in many parts of
   the country in winter.

   Of course, people can just buy a pocket AM radio for $1 now. But still,
   not having it stock will be a turnoff for many people outside cities.
   But demographically, I don't think BMW or Tesla expect to sell electric
   cars outside of the northeast and California.

     winter.

   really? its winter here, and all our cell towers are still working.
   Typically, cell towers are on a battery backup, and AT&T and
   friends(well, technically the company that bought all their towers) has
   gensets on trucks ready to roll for extended outages. Typically, the
   UPS batteries at cell towers are big enough to keep the tower up at
   full capacity for about 3 hours.

   the major corridors and major tourist traps have it just fine. I was
   there, never lost signal. If you hike away from the main tourist areas,
   signal is spotty, but way better than what their site says, as it has
   to be able to have people get ahold of emergency services. They have
   towers throughout the park, but they don't accept any calls or data
   except 911 calls, which is why they can claim that about 50% of the
   park is a "dead" zone, when its not really dead.

   There are plenty in Utah. You can go for 100 miles without a gas

   Not to mention the fact that the idea that an AM receiver could cause
   meaningful 'interference' is absolute bullshit. It's a fucking
   receiver.

   Edit: oh, it is because the car causes the interference. That makes
   more sense... but it makes me wonder: is the supply possibly in
   violation of FCC standards?

   Who turns to those for that information? That is also delivered to
   cellphones.

     Streaming is cool until you realize that it requires powered cell

   I fail to see how that is a drawback to streaming while not to AM radio

     Who turns to those for that information?

   A lot of people. Not everyone is glued to their cellphone and
   regardless AM radio functions even during power outages because AM
   radio transmitters and receivers can run off battery power. Not having
   AM radio as a stock feature is fine if your car is being sold to rich
   urbanites, but for people who live outside cities especially in places
   where it snows not having it is a turn-off.

   AM radio broadcasts for weather/road clearing alerts is important in
   most of the US. Important enough where if your car has "interference
   issues", people won't buy it. But, again, demographically speaking it's
   probably not a problem since electric cars are being sold primarily to
   urbanites.

   Could you cite some concrete examples of AM transmitters running off of
   battery power. When I was doing broadcast engineering, we had a 5
   kilowatt AM transmitter on 1380AM. At 80% efficiency, that is 6250
   watts. Batteries aren't going to last long at that power level.

   The battery is meant for fail-over for an automatic trip generator, to
   keep a continuous broadcast. It isn't something like a 15 minute run.

   All of my local AM and FM broadcasters have a system like that, so that
   outages don't knock them out.

   If you'd like, I can see what setup they have, if you want a similar
   system.

   No, we did not, but then we were in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,
   with no other stations around for 2500 miles.

   Sure, if you are only transmitting 50W, you can do that on batteries
   (or a generator).

     AM radio broadcasts for weather/road clearing alerts is important in
     most of the US

   Same story in rural parts of Canada

   Hell even in my home town of 17,000 people the cell towers are pretty
   unreliable and this town has cellular deadzones for all carriers all
   over the place.

   Power goes out in this town and both FM stations are silent for hours.
   sometimes they'll be out for a full day after power is back if it
   snowed badly enough. FM transmissions use too much power to run on a
   battery backup or even a backup generator.

   Lets back up: notice how I said urbanites are the people who are most
   likely to buy electric cars.

   In case you didn't know, the world outside major metro areas still uses
   AM radio because it's cheap and it works. It's still the best way to
   relay emergency information (road closures, snow advisories, power
   outage info, etc) and it's a thing people still use it for. Power
   outages are still a thing in many parts of the US, not routinely so but
   it's a concern many people still have. In this regard, AM radios still
   work through power cuts.

   That's a niche role. I get that. But it's also a role that isn't going
   away and it's a thing people outside metro areas expect to come stock
   with the vehicle they purchase. But, as I've also said, these people
   are probably not in the market for an electric car in the first place.

   Are you really stupid enough to ask when you use an emergency fall back
   plan? You use this stuff in an emergency, jackass.

   Most cell towers can only power themselves with generators for three
   days so even if the network is still up the cell phones are going away
   in a situation like the [512]Northeast blackout of 2003.

   Some Ham radio people go out and practice how to [513]run emergency
   communication networks as a community service. Also an AM radio
   receiver can be built out of [514]literal garbage and will likely be
   the last bit of communication tech still working in a really bad
   emergency.

   Just because you can't understand why emergency plans exist, doesn't
   mean they are useless.

   To be fair, the truth of this sorta undercuts the argument that having
   one in your car is necessary in an emergency.

   I'd still rather they solved the issue than just dumped it entirely,
   though.

   If you are in an emergency, though, I think the last thing you want to
   do is to try to build a radio by finding wire, wax, copper oxide, rusty
   razor blades, pencils, and the like without training and practice.

   However if you lived in the country where rough weather is common, you
   are going to want to have a small emergency kit in the trunk at all
   times anyway (flashlight, blanket, flares or whatever).

   So having a battery powered emergency radio should be pretty simple to
   keep in the car somewhere.

   I have read that CB radios can be useful for emergencies in areas
   without cell signals. They don't have a huge range, but could be
   helpful if you get stuck somewhere.

   Notice how the Northeast Blackout of 2003 happened in the Northeastern
   part of the US, aka the densest part of the US and by far the most
   urban. The rest of the US is not like that.

   2003 was also before digital VOIP systems came out. Analog landlines
   used to run during power outages too since they had their own power
   system as well. Not the case anymore due to the digitalization and
   computerization of it.

     Just because you can't understand why emergency plans exist, doesn't
     mean they are useless.

   90% of "emergency planning" is wishful thinking. If a telco company is
   not required to add a backup power system, they won't add it due to the
   added cost. Guess what? In podunk, USA where there's not a lot of ISP
   customers in the first place there's even less of an incentive to build
   these systems. Do you think AT&T will go the extra mile on that when
   they can't even offer consistent ISP service for their existing
   customers?

   I really think you should drive out into the wilderness and experience
   what I'm talking about. Most of the US is not New York or LA.

   In this context, you are talking about long term emergencies in which
   you wouldn't be tuning in while in an electric car. Your electric car
   will be long dead and you will be using a low power hand radio (I have
   a crank radio for this reason). I'm not saying they are obsolete and
   should go away. . .

   My comment was under the context of driving in your luxury electric car
   and getting weather alerts, not zombie apocalypses.

   When it comes to Amber alerts, when it happens I can expect to go to my

   disable emergency alerts. Either it woke them up while sleeping, or
   they simply find it offensive and want it permanently disabled.

   Absolutely bullshit. One of the reasons I didn't get the i3 is because
   of the lack of AM radio. It's a large part of my commute, and I don't
   want to always open up my phone, connect to the BMW, stream using my
   data, etc when instead I can just turn on the damn radio.

   Secondly, live sporting events are generally not available on the free
   streaming stations, so then I have to have a subscription to mlb and
   others. Plus you don't always get your home announcers using the mlb
   app. It's an extreme annoyance. I fully understand the problem (my
   Insight would get overpowered with interference when under large
   bridges for example) but the annoyance of a less than ideal AM
   experience is outweighed by not even having the option.

   It isn't cost effective, that's the point. I suspect Tesla knows that
   their electrics give off a lot of noise, and that if they put an AM
   radio in their car, it would just highlight the problem (e.g. customers
   would complain that the AM reception was crud).

   So it was a product management decision to leave the AM radio out.

   It's not the motors, but the solid state switch mode controllers
   powering the motors (similar to powersupplies in other devices, like
   computers) the power wires connecting the controllers to the motors act
   like broad cast antennas, that's where most of the problem lies, the
   motors themselves are already pretty well shielded inherently by
   design.

   Shielding this would require extensive, heavy steel shielding.
