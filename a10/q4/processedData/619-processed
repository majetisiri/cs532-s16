Forget Tesla's insane mode: Electric 'bullet car' set to reach 370mph in
latest record-breaking attempt

     * VBB-3 is latest model by Venturi Automobiles and Ohio State
       engineers, who set 307mph land record in 2010
     * Electric vehicle has 3,000 horsepower, and will try to become
       world's fastest car by hitting speeds of 372 mph
     * Inside, the 12-meter car has cables that total 3.5 miles, and
       contains 2,000 cells inside of eight battery packs

   At Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats, a new arrival is gearing up to break
   records on the legendary speedway.

   The VBB-3 is the collaborative project of [36]Venturi Automobiles and
   student engineers at Ohio State University, and it boasts nearly 3,000
   horsepower.

   This vehicle is the most powerful electric car in the world, and can
   hit speeds as high as 372 miles-per-hour. The team is hoping to take it
   for a record-breaking run this summer.

   It can go from 0 to 60 in just two seconds. This compares to Tesla's
   'Insane Mode' on its Model S electric cars that goes from 0 to 60 in
   3.2 seconds.

   According to [37]CNN, the first car that broke 300 mph was Malcolm
   Campbell's Bluebird, and it did so in 1935.

   Decades later, Monaco-based Venturi continues to push the boundaries.

   In 2010, the Venturi team set a world landspeed record with an earlier
   model, the VBBB-2.5, reaching 307 mph.

   Subsequent attempts by Venturi to break their own world record were put
   off by bad weather, with flooding in 2013 and slush in 2015.

   Student engineers at the Ohio State University's Center for Automotive
   Research (CAR) have examined every part of the 12-meter electric car,
   including an expanse of cables that cover nearly 3.5 miles.

   The 'electric streamliner' is 12 meters long, and contains 2,000 cells
   within eight battery packs.

VENTURI AUTOMOBILES RECORD BREAKING ATTEMPT

   The VBB-3 is part of a project by Venturi Buckeye Bullet racing team
   which began in 2009.

   The team set its first world landspeed record that year using a
   hydrogen fuel cell vehicle at 303mph.

   In 2010, Venturi set another world record, this time with a fully
   electric battery powered vehicle, the VBBB-2.5 which reached 307mph.

   Now, the team is looking to shatter its earlier records, by hitting 372
   mph this summer.

   'Along with our partners at CAR, we are aiming to exceed our own
   electric FIA Land Speed Record established in 2010 with the previous
   model – the Venturi Buckeye Bullet 2.5 We want to show all the
   potential of this very unique prototype,' said Venturi's lead project
   engineer Delphine Biscaye.

   Venturi is also working to manufacture vehicles in the FIA Formula-E
   championships, and even has its own racing team, to which the
   technologies are being integrated.

   'The knowledge we've gained form this project is being used on the
   Formula E project,' Biscaye told CNN.

   'In Formula E, we are a manufacturer this year, providing the
   powertrain.'

   Along with its high-speed capabilities, the VBB-3 is a test in electric
   propulsion and energy efficiency.

   The researchers allows engineers to understand how an electric vehicle
   of this kind can operate under harsh condition, which has potential
   benefits for other automobile makers, and Nasa.

   Biscaye tells CNN that many of the student engineers that work on the
   VBB-3 have moved on to major companies, like Ford and Nasa.

   The engineers are taking their innovative designs far beyond
   motorsports, and say the technology can apply to advancements not only
   in land speeds, but in electric and 'green' vehicles.
