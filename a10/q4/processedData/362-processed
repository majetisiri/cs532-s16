This Chipotle conspiracy theory is the craziest thing we’ve read all day

   Grab those tinfoil hats, readers: There’s a conspiracy afoot.

   Writing for [100]fringe website Natural News, self-described “Health
   Ranger” and apparent conspiracy theorist Mike Adams has an explanation
   for the Great Chipotle E. Coli Crisis of 2015: It wasn’t caused by
   contaminated beef that then spread to other ingredients, as
   [101]Chipotle itself suspects. Rather, Mike Adams says, it was “the
   result of the biotech industry unleashing bioterrorism attacks against
   the only fast food company that has publicly denounced GMOs.”

   That’s right: Bioterrorism against … burritos.

   [102]Adams continues:

     How do we know? The CDC has already admitted that some of these
     e.coli outbreaks involve a “rare genetic strain” of e.coli not
     normally seen in foods. Furthermore, we also know the track record
     of the biotech industry engaging in the most criminal, dirty,
     sleazebag tactics imaginable against any person or company that
     speaks out against GMOs.

     Doctor Oz, for example, was maliciously targeted in a defamation
     campaign funded by the biotech industry earlier this year. The
     onslaught against Oz was initiated because he publicly expressed his
     support for honest GMO labeling on foods.

     As the attacks escalated, Doctor Oz had his own team investigate the
     source of the attacks and [103]found they were all biotech industry
     shills, some with felony criminal records and long histories of
     dubious propaganda activities targeting anti-GMO activists.

   The Doctor Oz he’s referring to, by the way, is a daytime TV host who
   has made a fortune promoting quack medicine to the masses. In addition
   to his criticism of GMOs, Oz gave airtime to proponents of “reparative
   therapy” for homosexuality and has been accused by Sen. Claire
   McKaskill of shilling misleading and ineffective weight loss products.

   In fact, 10 physicians asked Columbia University to sever its ties with
   Dr. Oz in 2014, [104]alleging that the doctor “has repeatedly shown
   disdain for science and for evidence-based medicine, as well as
   baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food
   crops. Worst of all, he has manifested an egregious lack of integrity
   by promoting quack treatments and cures in the interest of personal
   financial gain.”

   Regardless, Adams believes him, and also believes that some unknown
   corporate evil-doer put E. coli in your burrito bowl. His evidence? He
   doesn’t really have any, but no matter: The article has been
   [105]shared on Facebook over 30,000 times, quite often by well-meaning
   environmentalists. It was published in December, but we didn’t have the
   strength to give it more than a cursory side eye until [106]New York
   Magazine wrote about it.

   As Jesse Singal wrote: “It is bizarre to see the anti-corporate granola
   crowd lining up to defend the integrity of a corporate behemoth like
   Chipotle, but there you have it. This is what happens when a given
   debate becomes so politicized, so tightly wound up in people’s
   political identities, that common sense and objectivity get tossed into
   the garbage like a day-old burrito.” And nowhere is that more apparent
   than in [107]the fight over GMOs.
