Pulled Pork Taco Recipe

   February 5, 2016 by [18]Scott G [19]6 Comments

   If you love Mexican style food, then this post is for you!  Not only
   are you going to get the pulled pork taco recipe, but a delicious
   recipe for Pico de Gallo AND a recipe for a delicious Chipotle Pepper
   Sauce.  When you put all three of these recipes together, the flavor
   explosion is incredible.  Let’s check it out.

This pulled pork taco recipe is: Gluten Free, Paleo Friendly, Low Carb and
delightfully spicy.

   A perfectly delicious pulled pork taco recipe with pico de gallo salsa
   and a delicious chipotle pepper sauce! A Mexican fiesta!

Pico de Gallo, Spice and everything nice in this Pulled Pork Taco Recipe.

   Pulled pork and tacos were meant to be together.  Pulled pork is just
   so juicy, flavorful and delicious.  It’s like it wants to be put into a
   corn tortilla and be smothered with awesome fresh ingredients.  The
   freshness is one of the things I love so much about Mexican style food.
    We’re going to be using my recipe for [20]easy pulled pork which I
   posted a while ago.  We’re also going to be making some super fresh
   pico de gallo and a really spicy chipotle pepper sauce.  A pulled pork
   taco recipe that is just full of yum.

Making Pulled Pork

   Pulled pork takes time.  There is no way around it.  Typically, I make
   an 8lb shoulder and freeze off portions to be used in the future.  I
   don’t always have six hours to wait for dinner to be ready!  If you
   don’t have any pulled pork ready to go and are a bit short on time,
   take a look at my [21]easy shredded chicken recipe.  It will be equally
   delicious and ready in much less time.

   I’m working with a friend of mine to put together a recipe for pressure
   cooker carnitas which should be ready in about an hour.  The pressure
   cooker is an incredible piece of equipment to have on hand to speed
   things up when working with tougher cuts of meat.  Right now we are
   working on the right balance of fat, spice and meat to go into the
   pressure cooker to make the most delicious carnitas you can imagine.
   Should be an awesome recipe!

   For this pulled pork taco recipe, I’ve assumed that you have pulled
   pork already made or are planning on making it.  There are links
   through to how to make some delicious pulled pork in the recipe or
   earlier in this post!

Putting together the Pico de Gallo

   Pico is one of my favorite salsas.  It is simple, packs a ton of flavor
   and can be adjusted easily for spice.  In this pico recipe, I used
   jalapeno peppers which turned out to be incredibly spicy.  Have you
   noticed that sometimes you get jalapeno which is not too spicy, but
   sometimes you get ones that are outrageously loaded with capsaicin (the
   spicy part of the pepper).  Well, these were HOT.  I could feel the
   heat in my nose when I first cut into the pepper.  For me, it was
   perfect.

   If you’re not into the heat, pick up an Anaheim (very mild) or add in a
   green bell pepper.  Looking for just a bit of heat?  The poblano pepper
   might be up your alley. These can pack some heat too… just one of those
   things you can’t tell by looking at one.  If you love the heat, buy
   jalapeno, serrano or kick it way up with habanero.  My suggestion is to
   wear gloves if you are slicing anything above a jalapeno.

   For the pico de gallo recipe, just make sure that you get the freshest
   ingredients you can.  I know that at different times of the year
   tomatoes don’t always look or taste the best.  When you are at the
   grocery, see which type looks the most red and get those.  It doesn’t
   matter whether it is a plum or a vine tomato.  Look for the most ripe
   and delicious.

   You’ll see that I use shallot in my pico rather than red or sweet
   onions.  I like the flavor of the shallot more than these other types.
    Sometimes sweet onions aren’t available at my local market and I find
   that the red onions can overpower a salsa quickly.  The shallot does a
   great job of being relatively mild but still adding enough onion flavor
   to make the salsa stand out.  It’s your choice what to use.  Recipes
   are just guidelines!

Putting together the Chipotle Pepper Sauce

   Wow.  This sauce has some huge flavor and a LOT of spice.  I use the
   hot Hungarian wax pepper in this recipe to really make sure that you
   know you’re eating something spicy.  But it’s not just spice for the
   sake of being hot.  There are really delicious flavors in here with the
   sauteed onions and garlic along with the adobo chile sauce.  The
   chipotle pepper sauce kicks this pulled pork taco recipe way up in the
   flavor department.

   When you are making this sauce, I would suggest using your ventilation
   system when sauteing the wax peppers.  The vapor has a tendency to make
   you cough a bit and might burn your eyes just a touch.  I would not
   lean in and breathe in the steam from the pan under any circumstances.
    Keep a lid on the pan when they are being cooked to reduce the vapor.
    It definitely helps a lot!

   I like to make this sauce in my vitamix and leave a little “chunk” to
   it.  Just add all the ingredients into the vitamix or your blender,
   turn it on a low speed and let it go for a couple minutes.

   QUICK COOKING TIP: If you’re looking for some additional toppings for
   this pulled pork taco recipe, try some sliced black olives or pieces of
   sliced avocado.  Check out my quick picture tutorial on [22]how to peel
   an avocado to make some beautiful avocado slices.  We love to add in
   some shredded cheese and some whole kernel corn.  Really tasty.

   Let’s get to this pulled pork taco recipe.
   Working with the freshest ingredients really make this pulled pork taco
   recipe stand out. Making the pico de gallo and chipotle pepper sauce
   packs a huge flavor punch!!

   Super fresh, heirloom tomatoes are about to get chopped up to go into
   the Pico de Gallo salsa. I just wanted to take a bite of these super
   juicy tomatoes.
   To make the pulled pork taco recipe really stand out, making the pico
   de gallo and chipotle pepper sauce is really important! Super fresh
   ingredients make Mexican food taste great!

   The Pico de Gallo takes about 5 minutes to put together. The flavors
   just pop on this pulled pork taco recipe.
   A super fresh pulled pork taco recipe with pico de gallo and a fresh
   chipotle pepper sauce. So delicious!

   This super fresh pulled pork taco recipe goes great with the pico de
   gallo and spicy chipotle pepper sauce. Perfect for a Mexican fiesta!
   Ingredients
   For the Pulled Pork Taco
     * 2 LBS Pulled Pork (see how to make [24]slow cooked pulled pork)
     * 2 TBSP Olive Oil
     * 2-3 TBSP Cajun Seasoning
     * Corn Tortilla Shells

   For the Pico de Gallo
     * 2 Cups Tomato, diced
     * ⅓ Cup Shallot, chopped fine
     * ¼ Cup Jalapeno, diced (or more if you want more spice). This is
       approx 2 regular jalapenos.
     * ¼ Cup Lime Juice
     * ¼ Cup Cilantro, chopped
     * 1 TSP Lime Zest
     * ½ TSP Dried Oregano
     * 1 TSP Kosher Salt

   For the Chipotle Pepper Sauce
     * ½ Cup Red Onion, diced
     * 2 Cloves Garlic, sliced
     * 1 Hot Wax Pepper, seeded and sliced into ⅛” rings
     * ¼ Cup plus 2 TBSP olive oil
     * ¼ Cup Lime Juice
     * ¼ Cup Apple Cider Vinegar (I use Braggs) or Red Wine Vinegar
     * ¼ Cup Chiles in Adobo sauce (use a spoon to scoop it out of the
       can)
     * Kosher salt

   Instructions
   For the Pulled Pork
    1. Add the pulled pork to a pan over medium heat with the olive oil.
       When the pork starts to warm, add in the cajun seasoning. Mix well
       and set aside, covered, when hot.

   For the Pico de Gallo
    1. Add all ingredients to a bowl. Mix well and let sit for about 30
       minutes before serving.

   For the Chipotle Pepper Sauce
    1. In a saute pan, heat 1 TBSP of the olive oil over medium-high heat.
       Add in the onion with a pinch of salt. Cook for 7-8 minutes,
       stirring occasionally. Add in the garlic and cook for 2 more
       minutes, stirring frequently. When cooked, add to the blender.
    2. In the same pan, heat the second TBSP of olive oil. Add in the wax
       peppers and a pinch of salt. Cover the pan. Cook for 4-5 minutes or
       until lightly browned and softened just a bit. Add the cooked
       peppers to the blender.
    3. Add all remaining ingredients to the blender. Blend on low speed
       for 2-3 minutes or until a thick sauce forms.

   Putting together the Pulled Pork Tacos
    1. Heat your saute pan with a quick spray of olive oil or non-stick
       spray over high heat. Add in the corn tortilla and heat through to
       soften. I like mine with some areas of crispy brown spots.
    2. Fill the tortilla with a mound of pulled pork, a drizzle of the
       spicy chipotle pepper sauce and a heaping of the pico de gallo.
    3. Enjoy hot and happy eating!

   Notes
   Please note that the cook times here assume that you already have
   cooked pulled pork made. If not, depending on how you cook it, you
   should add between 2-8 hours to the recipe for cooking time.

   Final thoughts on the Pulled Pork Taco Recipe:

   The one component which I didn’t give the recipe for is the sour cream
   drizzle.  It’s really easy to make.  I use 1/2 cup of full fat sour
   cream, 2 TBSP cream or 1/2 and 1/2.  Give it a pinch of kosher salt,
   add to a squeeze bottle and shake it around.  You’ll have sour cream
   with just enough body to stay on top of the ingredients.  The pinch of
   salt makes it just delicious!

   [26]easy guacamole recipe.  Or if you’re not feeling the pork, take a
   look at my [27]low carb chicken fajita recipe which is really fun to
   eat.  If you decide to make the pulled pork and have leftovers, I’m
   putting together a pulled pork soup recipe that will be posted up soon!
