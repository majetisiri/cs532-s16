   A furious car owner vented his anger when he came back with a date to
   find someone had left excrement on his brand new vehicle.

   The man posted a lengthy warning note on Craigslist complaining of his
   harrowing episode in Chicago.

   He was walking back to his shiny Tesla Model X, an electric-powered
   'sports utility vehicle' which cost from around $80,000, when the
   incident happened.
   Michael's angry letter which he posted on Craigslist - in it he says he
   would offer a financial reward to anyone who comes forward with
   information

   In the post he said: 'I was on a date with a girl, who was very
   conservative. It was our third date and when we walked out, sure enough
   we saw that someone had taken a very large s**t on my
   windshield...leading me to believe that perhaps someone had s**t in a
   container at home and then threw it on my car later.'

   Michael said his date was 'really traumatized' and claimed police
   officers 'absolutely refused' to help him.

   The 36-year-old added: 'I had to use a redeye magazine and a bottle of
   water to clean it off and that sucked.'

   Michael has now started his own investigation and is looking for 'solid
   intelligence' into the incident.

   He has even kept a sample of the excrement as he fears his car may be
   targeted again.

   '...I will plan on ruling you out with DNA for I have kept a sample of
   the s**t for I can see someone trying to pull another fast one on me,'
   he added.

   'And trust me, that is not going to happen. Taking dumps on a person's
   car is something children do, not adults. And although from time to
   time, I could see why someone deserves it, this was absolutely uncalled
   for.'

   Michael is offering 'significant compensation' to anyone who helps
   conclude his case although he has yet to publish a reward figure.

   His final paragraph of anger begins: 'Lastly, a message to the person
   who did this: I will find you. Do you understand me? I have already had
   my lawyer draft up subpoena to acquire footage from
   nearby security cameras amongst other things.

   'Personally, I think you need medical attention to do what you have
   done.'

       revealed. Daenerys meets a strong man. Cersei sees her daughter
       again.\nSeven noble families fight for control of the mythical land
       of Westeros. Political and sexual intrigue is pervasive. Across the
       sea, the last members of the previous and deposed ruling family,
       the Targaryens, are also scheming to regain the throne. The
       friction between the houses Stark, Lannister and Baratheon, and
       with the remaining great houses Greyjoy, Tully, Arryn, and Tyrell,
       leads to full-scale war. All while a very ancient evil awakens in
       the farthest north. Amidst the war and political confusion, a
       neglected military order of misfits, the Night's Watch, is all that
       stands between the realms of men and icy horrors beyond. \n
