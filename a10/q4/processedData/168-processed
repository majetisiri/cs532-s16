   Whether it's the bite of jalapenos or the smokiness of chipotle,
   chillis help to take these two dishes far away from the ordinary.

   PULLED PORK AND COLESLAW BURGERS WITH CHIPOTLE MAYO

   2kg pork shoulder, bone in

   ½ tbsp mustard powder

   1 tbsp cumin powder
   Advertisement

   1 tbsp coriander powder

   1 tbsp brown sugar

   sea salt and freshly ground pepper

   4 tbsp vegetable oil

   1 brown onion, roughly chopped

   4 cloves garlic, chopped

   1 cup lager

   2 cups chicken stock, approximately

   fresh milk buns, to serve (from Brasserie Bread in Sydney and
   Melbourne)

   For the coleslaw

   ½ small head (or ¼ large) white cabbage, shredded

   ½ small head (or ¼ large) red cabbage, shredded

   2 large carrots, shredded

   1 tsp celery seeds

   1 tbsp wholegrain mustard

   ¼ cup apple cider vinegar

   1 tbsp honey

   ¼ cup grapeseed oil

   For the mayonnaise

   1 cup mayonnaise

   2 tbsp lime juice

   chipotle powder, to taste

   Serves 10-12

   Remove skin from pork and trim off any excess fat. Combine the mustard,
   cumin, coriander, brown sugar, ½ tbsp salt and 1 tsp pepper. Rub the
   mix onto the pork, covering all areas. Allow to sit for 30 minutes.

   Preheat oven to 150°C.

   Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until almost
   smoking. Add pork and brown on all sides, 5 to 6 minutes total. Set
   aside.

   Add onion, garlic and a pinch of salt. Fry for 3-4 minutes, stirring
   constantly, until beginning to brown, then add lager. Scrape bottom to
   release any stuck bits and simmer for a minute. Add stock and place
   pork back into pot. Bring to a simmer, cover with a lid, then transfer
   to the oven. Cook, turning the pork every hour, until it is tender,
   about 3½-4 hours.

   For the coleslaw, combine the cabbage, carrot and celery seeds. Whisk
   together remaining ingredients, check seasoning, then gradually add the
   dressing to the vegetables.

   For the mayo, combine ingredients, adding chipotle powder to taste.

   Serve the pork at the table with mayonnaise, coleslaw and fresh milk
   buns, for everyone to make their own burgers.
