Tesla Model 3: What We Know About Its $35,000, 200-Mile Electric Car

   There are now 100,000 Tesla Model S electric cars on the roads, and its
   Model X crossover finally struggled into production last fall.

   Since that time, long-range plans by Tesla Motors for a third, smaller,
   and much less expensive range of electric cars continue draw huge
   interest.

   Little bits and pieces of news have filtered out, but now the big
   allure is the promised public debut of a concept for the car this
   spring.

   DON'T MISS: [76]Is Chevy Bolt EV's Main Mission To Marginalize Tesla
   Electric Cars?

   Here's what we know so far.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: When we first published this article in June 2013, Tesla
   had built barely 10,000 Model S cars. A great deal has changed for that
   model in two and a half years, but we've learned remarkably little
   about the Model 3 since then. Still, with its debut just weeks away, we
   thought this was a good time to update the piece as much as possible.

   CODE NAME: The new compact sedan was originally called the "Blue Star,"
   following in line with "White Star," which turned into the Model S.

   MODEL NAME: Tesla had intended to call its third-generation car the
   Model E, meaning that its three volume vehicles would be the S-E-X
   trio. We'll leave you to ponder that one.

   However, Ford turned out to have a prior trademark on the Model E, and
   declined to release it. The car that Tesla intends to be its
   high-volume, mass-market entry is now called the Model 3.

   Typographically, that is often rendered as three stacked horizontal
   lines, as in the Tesla logo. We don't use that on this site because the
   character doesn't render properly on all devices.

   BODY STYLES: A compact sedan, described as a BMW 3-Series competitor,
   will come first.

   It will be followed by a crossover utility vehicle on the same
   platform, which Musk referred to in a 2015 tweet as the "Model
   Y"--following on the Model X larger crossover, presumably.

   POSITIONING: Musk told [79]Bloomberg in May 2013 that the new model
   will be a "compelling, affordable car" that's far less costly than the
   Model S, but nicer than the high-volume Nissan Leaf.

   "What the world really needs is a great, affordable electric car," Musk
   said in the interview.

   "I’m not going to let anything go, no matter what people offer, until I
   complete that mission.”

   (Jul 2013)

   RANGE: The new model will have a range of about 200 miles, Musk has
   often said.

   There may well be more than one battery offering, as there is in the
   Model S, to give higher ranges at additional cost.

   TIMING: When the Model X was expected to [81]go on sale at the end of
   2014, Musk said the new, smaller Tesla will go into production in late
   2016.

   That timing has now moved to the end of 2017 or early 2018, and if
   history is any guide, that date could slip further.

   Volume production in the hundreds of thousands likely won't occur until
   2020 or so--assuming everything goes well.

   We now know, however, that Tesla plans to unveil a design for the Model
   3 next month.

   Rumors suggest it will be at the Geneva Motor Show, but that would be
   atypical for Tesla, which rarely appears at or makes major
   announcements at auto shows.

   We also don't know if this will be a design study, an "alpha"
   development vehicle, or a proposed final production model.
