Slow Cooker Barbecue Ribs

   Slow-Cooker Barbecue Ribs - The broiling gives the ribs great smoky
   flavor and gives them a barbecued appearance. It's not necessary to
   broil, but highly recommend to boost the flavor and texture.

Slow-Cooker Barbecue Ribs - another great super easy recipe with a couple fun
twists. One of the ingredients is a cola like Cherry Coke or regular.

Slow-Cooker Barbecue Ribs - It's never too early to start thinking about
Memorial Day weekend! We're dreaming of these to-die-for slow-cooker ribs
that are easy to make, rain or shine.

Yes, you can make authentic-tasting slow-cooker barbecue ribs. Here’s the
proof! Cola is the secret to this sauce—it keeps the meat incredibly moist
while cooking, so you're left with fall-off-the-bone tender ribs that will
satisfy even the most serious barbecue craving, no grill required. For added
smoky flavor and texture, we recommend finishing off these slow-cooker ribs
for a few minutes in your broiler.

Chipotle Shredded Pork - replaced chile peppers with 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
and 1/4 tsp chili powder. I would cook it on low 1 hour longer next time.

Chipotle Shredded Pork is so versatile. Serve it as tacos warmed corn
tortillas with all of the fixings. It also makes a great filling for
enchiladas or burritos. Or serve it as a part of a nacho bar.

Throw a Mexican fiesta for Father's Day! Serve Chipotle Shredded Pork with
his favorite fixin's. Don't forget the chips and salsa!

Here's an idea, set up a taco bar centering around Chipotle Shredded Pork for
your party. Any toppings will do.

Summer is quickly approaching and that means it will be too hot to cook. No
