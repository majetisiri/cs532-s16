Quick Veggie Burrito Bowls with Chipotle Sauce + $100 VISA Gift card Giveaway

   February 2, 2016 by [25]Layla [26]138 Comments
   Quick Veggie Burrito Bowls with Chipotle Sauce Over the past few years,
   [27]burrito bowls have become an essential part of our dinner routine.
   We have them at least once a week. We love them because they are quick
   and easy to prepare, and are packed with tons of veggies and healthy
   protein. We usually make the burrito bowls with white rice but to make
   them ever healthier, we’ve started using brown rice or quinoa. I’ve
   never been a fan of multi-grain rice until recently when I discovered
   that if you’re eating it in a burrito bowl, it blends in perfectly with
   all the zesty flavors!  You guys know I like my recipes quick and
   simple. Who has time to wait for an hour for a bowl of rice?! Quick
   Veggie Burrito Bowls with Chipotle Sauce
   When I heard about this quick [28]Minute® Multi-Grain Medley Rice, I
   knew I had to try it! It’s a blend of four gluten-free, 100% whole
   grains, including long grain brown rice, Thai red rice, wild rice and
   quinoa and it conveniently cooks in 10 minutes. Plus, it comes in
   pre-portioned bags, making it even easier to prep. It cooked while I
   was preparing the toppings for my burrito bowls, and within 10 minutes
   it was ready! It was soft, fluffy and delicious! I love it because it
   has similar nutritional values as regular long cooking brown rice, but
   is ready in just 10 minutes, – ¼ the time!! It’s also gluten-free, too.
   Quick Veggie Burrito Bowls with Chipotle Sauce These burrito bowls are
   vegetarian but steak, shrimp, or chicken can easily be added. I used
   black beans, lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, and homemade tortilla strips.
   I made the tortilla strips by simply slicing a flour tortilla into
   small strips and pan frying them until golden. They make a perfect
   topping for burrito bowls and add texture and delicious flavor to the
   bowls.

   You can also add corn, fajita veggies, pico- gallo, guacamole, or salsa
   for even more flavor! The possibilities are endless! Quick Veggie
   Burrito Bowls with Chipotle Sauce I finished off these burrito bowls
   with a drizzle of my award-winning [29]chipotle sauce. It’s smoky,
   spicy and delicious. It’s made from canned chipotle and can be prepared
   in under 5 minutes. Quick Veggie Burrito Bowls with Chipotle Sauce

   Author: Layla
   Recipe type: Main
   Cuisine: Mexican
   Serves: 4
   Ingredients
     * 4 pre-portioned bags of Minute® - Multi-Grain Medley (any other
       type of Minute Rice can also be used)
     *
       Black beans:
     * 1 tablespoon oil
     * ¼ onion, diced
     * 1 cloves garlic, minced
     * 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
     * 1 teaspoon cumin
     * ½ teaspoon chili powder
     * ½ teaspoon garlic powder
     * Toppings:
     * 2 avocados, diced or slices
     * 2 cups lettuce, shredded
     * 1 cup diced tomatoes
     * 1 cup cheddar cheese
     * ¼ cup chopped cilantro
     * 1 lime
     * ½ cup sour-cream
     * Chipotle sauce
     * 1 chipotle chile in adobo sauce plus 1 tsp. sauce (canned)
     * ½ cup mayonnaise
     * ⅓ cup plain Greek yogurt
     * ¼ cup chopped cilantro
     * ¼ tsp. ground cumin
     * ¼ tsp. dried dill
     * Kosher salt, to taste

   Instructions
    1. Cook [32]Multi-Grain Medley rice according to package instructions.
    2. To cook black beans: While the rice is cooking, heat a medium pan
       on medium/high heat. Add the onions and saute for 3-5 minutes or
       until soft. Add the garlic and saute for 20 seconds. Add the black
       beans and spices. Cook for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set
       aside.
    3. To make Chipotle sauce:
    4. Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor and puree
       until smooth about 2-3 minutes or until the mixture is nice and
       creamy. Pour into a jar or small bowl and refrigerate for up to 4
       weeks.
    5. To assemble:
    6. Pour 1 serving of rice in a medium serving bowl. Top with black
       beans, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes, cheddar cheese, cilantro,
       sour-cream and a wedge of lime. Drizzle chipotle sauce by placing a
       few tablespoons into a ziplock bag and cutting the corner. Enjoy!

   Notes
   I cooked the beans in onions and garlic to add extra flavor. This is
   optional and if desired, the beans can be used out of the can.
