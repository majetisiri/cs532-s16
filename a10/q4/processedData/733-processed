The Founder of Kickstarter on Why He’s “Not Some Rich Tech Dude With a Tesla”

   [19]January 29, 2016 [20]cfb

   By Mallory Greene @wealthsimple.com Crowdfundbeat Guest Post

   My parents split up when I was 10, and it felt like they were consumed
   with that drama for years. My sister and I ended up living with our
   dad, who’s an international marketing consultant. He’d always joke, “I
   don’t really know what that means, but that’s what I do.” Being the
   classic Midwestern midcentury stoic dude, he wanted to protect us from
   any financial stresses, but at times, we were close to tatters, times
   when my dad had lost his job and couldn’t make rent for his apartment.
   He could only hide it so much—some situation or another would make it
   very clear that we might be close to being totally screwed.

   I always wanted to be an architect. In the library, I’d spend hours
   looking at Mies van der Rohe’s buildings but my dad would always tell
   me, there’s no money in architecture. So I went to Purdue for
   mechanical engineering, and in the midst of that I stumbled upon
   something that I really loved— doing design work for record labels, and
   designing their websites. It was just a creative outlet, tinkering. I
   realized that I could make a living doing the thing that felt like play
   to me. So I dropped out of Purdue to work as a Web designer and
   developer.

   My connection to money is fairly weak, to be honest. I inherited my
   father’s work ethic—workaholism—but the drive behind my work has never
   been purely about money.

   People think that if you’re going to start a tech company, you’re going
   to become exorbitantly wealthy. The truth is most entrepreneurs don’t
   succeed. We were certainly part of the lucky few who came out with a
   massive success on our hands, but the goal was never about getting
   rich. It was about empowering people. That’s what drove us. That’s what
   fueled my work ethic. I think this becomes clear with our transition to
   become a public-benefit corporation. And I’d say this shift in the
   company is a great reflection of how I think about money and work: You
   need to be balanced.

   So no, I’m not some rich tech dude with a Tesla. In fact, I usually
   convince myself not to buy things, and I’ve always been very wary of
   credit cards. Building Kickstarter was probably one of the hardest
   feats I’ve been through in my life. To make that point: In 2007, I was
   in Salt Lake City visiting part of our team. At midnight, in my hotel
   room, my heart started pounding, and my mouth went cold and dry. I
   thought I was having a heart attack. Thankfully it was only a panic
   attack, but it felt so real to me. The pressure was real: balancing
   zero income with the drive to see this thing through along with my
   cofounders.

   Adding to this pressure, my daughter, Phoebe, was born in February
   2009, two months and two days before we launched Kickstarter in April.

   Two years ago, I left Kickstarter after seven years. I could have
   stayed but felt I had to explore new ideas.

   Leaving Kickstarter was certainly scary. I’d never founded a company
   that was as successful or visible as Kickstarter, so I didn’t know what
   the other side of that was going to look like. But we had some savings
   to fall back on, plus I planned to consult, and my wife would return to
   work. This has allowed us to support ourselves while still making time
   as a family—even for little things, like dropping my daughter off at
   school and going to the park, which were admittedly things I’d not been
   able to effectively prioritize. Again, workaholism.

   Now my wife has more anxiety about money that I do. She came here from
   Korea when she was three, and her parents ran a little electronics
   store in Chicago. It was a very minimalist upbringing. We don’t fight
   about money, but we talk about it frequently, in terms of livelihood
   versus our life-lihood, how we can have the financial lifestyle we want
   but not work too much so that we can be more involved in our daughter’s
   life.

   Would I want to leave Phoebe a lot of money? Actually I think the
   answer to that would be no; I want to leave her independence. Which is
   not the same thing. And I think we could do something with money that
   has a greater impact than just leaving a trust fund for our
   daughter—arts philanthropy for instance. Right now I’m fascinated with
   the idea of B Corps—for-profit companies applying themselves to social
   impact, the intersection of mission and profit. I love the idea of
   being able to create another company based on the ideals we wove into
   Kickstarter: that you can create a profitable business that’s also
   creating a positive social impact, and the success of the platform
   means the success of the community. This is what’s important to me.
