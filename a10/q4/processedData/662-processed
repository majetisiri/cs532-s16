Apple, Amazon, Tesla and the Changing Dynamics of the Car Industry

   Writing is a very weird experience for me. Sometimes it feels almost
   like an act of divine intervention. Not because of the divinity of it,
   but because of the intervention part. It’s almost as if I were a
   conduit for a guy (at least I hope it’s a guy) inside my head trying to
   communicate with my readers. I sit down to write, and letters spill
   into words and then into sentences, and then I see these new ideas and
   find myself thinking, “Wow, I wish I’d thought of this!”

   After I submitted [8]my previous column, on the financial innovation
   taking place at Apple, I learned that Sprint, T-Mobile and now Verizon
   are all fighting to best one another’s iPhone offers. What is really
   amazing about the situation is that no matter how this war among
   wireless carriers plays out, there will be one clear winner — Apple.
   And in the end, the carriers will be collective losers — they’ll be
   killing their margins to out-subsidize one another. They will be
   spending millions of dollars on advertising to get customers to come to
   their stores to buy — yes, Apple iPhones. If consumers choose Apple’s
   iPhone Upgrade Program instead of the carriers’, then Apple will win
   even bigger (as I argued in that column). In the meantime, 2015 will
   likely mark the year that AT&T’s and Verizon’s U.S. wireless service
   businesses went from growth to stagnation.

   Another observation about [9]Apple: Its brand extends far beyond
   technology and coolness. Over the years, the company has accumulated
   incredible goodwill with consumers. There is only one other company
   that comes to mind that has generated a similar amount of affection:
   Amazon.com. Amazon made shopping online easy, its customer service is
   impeccable, and it is transparent with consumers about pricing. After
   all, it allows other merchants to sell their merchandise through its
   website. Amazon will even ship it for them.

   Consumers’ trust in Amazon’s pricing is so great that most people don’t
   even bother with comparison shopping anymore; they skip Google (which
   is not good news for Google, by the way) and go directly to Amazon. I
   recently found myself willing to pay a few dollars more on Amazon than
   on a competitor’s website because I knew that if I needed to return the
   product, the process would be seamless. That goodwill turns Apple and
   Amazon into “platforms” (a very trendy word on Wall Street now),
   allowing them to launch a wide variety of new products.

   When Apple comes out with the Apple car, rumored to be due in 2019, it
   will be able to grab a disproportionately large market share from the
   General Motors of the world because of that deep well of goodwill.

   By the time my youngest child, Mia Sarah, who is almost two, learns to
   drive, internal combustion engines will likely be a relic consigned to
   museums (just like Ford’s Model T). I had an “aha!” moment when I
   recently visited a [10]Teslastore and saw its cars’ power train. It
   looks just like a skateboard — it basically consists of a flat slab of
   metal (which houses the battery), four wheels and an electric engine
   the size of a large watermelon. That’s it — the Tesla has only 18
   moving parts. I don’t know how many moving parts an internal combustion
   engine (ICE) car has, but it must be hundreds if not thousands.
   Interestingly, ICE cars also have more electronics than a Tesla.

   Wall Street is going gaga over the stocks of dealerships (especially
   after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought Van Tuyl Group) and
   car makers. I am in the minority, but I think that party will come to
   an end. Just like Tesla, Apple is not going to be using a dealership
   model to sell its cars. It would not want the Apple car buying
   experience to be tainted by a sleazy car salesman. Just as with the
   iPhone, the company will want to have complete control of the buying
   experience.

   If both Tesla and Apple bypass the dealership model, the GMs of the
   world will be at an even larger competitive disadvantage. They will
   have to abandon the dealership model too. Yes, I know, selling cars
   directly to consumers is not legal in many states, but if the U.S.
   Constitution could be amended 27 times, the law on car sales (which is
   an artifact of the Great Depression) can be amended as well.

   The traditional dealership model is unlikely to survive anyway, as its
   economics dramatically degrade in the electric-car world. A car that
   has very few moving parts and minimal electronics has few things to
   break; and consequently, electric cars will need less
   servicing — throttling the dealerships’ most important profit center.

   The baby boomer generation romanticizes cars. Most boomers can recite
   the horsepower and other engine specs of every car they have ever
   owned. For the tail end of Gen X (my generation) and Millennials, a car
   is an interruption between [11]Facebook and Twitter. We know the brand
   of speakers in our car, but if asked would have to google its
   horsepower. We feel little romanticism for our cars and have much
   higher brand loyalty to Apple and Google than to GM or Ford.

   What is also amazing about electric cars is that they aren’t that much
   different from smartphones. Smartphone prices have declined
   significantly over the years because their components became ubiquitous
   and commoditized. With the exception of spark plugs and tires, most
   components of a GM car will be different from the ones you’ll find in a
   Ford. The opportunity for scaled manufacturing and so commoditization
   is very limited in the auto industry.

   The simplicity of electric cars and the declining ambition of Tesla,
   Apple and whoever else enters that space to be known as a “car” company
   will likely lead to commoditization of components and thus lower
   prices. Tesla today is more a software and battery company than a car
   company. (As we recently discovered, Volkswagen is a lot more of a
   “software” company than we thought.)

   Think back eight years ago to the day when Apple introduced the iPhone.
   No one suspected that it (and the smartphones that followed) would
   enable a service like[12]Uber, which is busy putting cabdrivers
   worldwide out of business. The unforeseen consequences of the advent of
   electric cars will reverberate much farther than the demise of
   dealerships and significant shifts in market share in the auto
   industry.

   Gasoline can only be made from oil. (Yes, there is ethanol, but the
   economics of ethanol in the U.S. are problematic.) Sources of
   electricity are diverse — natural gas, coal, nuclear, solar, wind,
   hydro, oil (and I’m sure I’m forgetting something). Seventy percent of
   oil goes into cars and trucks. Just imagine for a second the shifts in
   global political alliances if oil lost its luster. The U.S. might
   forget how to spell “Saudi Arabia,” and the Middle East might start
   looking very different.

   Apple may find its 2019 date for the Apple car to be a bit optimistic,
   but nevertheless, its entrance into the auto industry will likely be
   successful and very disruptive. After all, it has the much-needed
   software know-how to design a car (it is already working with car
   companies on CarPlay, the iPhone-centered car infotainment system), it
   boasts a global network of stores, it has a deep well of goodwill with
   a billion fans globally, it possesses unlimited resources ($150 billion
   of net cash, and it generates $50 billion of free cash flows a year),
   and its imagination has not been damaged by decades of producing cars
   with internal combustion engines.

   Let me stress that last point. There is a very good reason why Nokia,
   which at one time was the dominant cellphone manufacturer, failed to
   compete with Apple’s iPhone. It had too much institutional knowledge.
   It had hundreds of engineers who tried to add IQ to a dumb phone. They
   were attempting to convert Symbian, a dumb phone operating system, into
   a smart phone operating system. Despite Apple showing Nokia how the
   smartphone should look, they couldn’t see their product as a smartphone
   but rather just as the next iteration of a dumb phone.

   General Motors’ answer to Tesla was not any different from Nokia’s
   response to the iPhone. GM came out with the Chevy Volt, which was
   really one of its internal combustion engine cars with an electric
   engine dumped in. Unless an ICE car company creates a silo unit
   isolated from the rest of the operation, it will be very difficult if
   not impossible to get engineers who have designed ICE vehicles all
   their lives to suddenly change the paradigm of their thinking and turn
   into electric-car engineers.
