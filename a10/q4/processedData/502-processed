       It's Chipotle. Like every other Chipotle out there. Except
       sometimes this one overloads tortillas and cant fit everything in
       so they double wrap it. And by sometimes I mean pretty much all the
       time. Not a bad problem to have.

       WAY OVER RATED, NOT 4 STARS AT ALL.
       Service line was long but moved at a good pace. I ordered a
       Barbacoa burrito which came ripped in the middle, you all know how
       annoying that is, the worse part was that a took a bite and the
       meat felt like rubber, was not chewable and I had to pull it out of
       my mouth (disgusting right? But I wasn't gonna swallow that blob of
       rubber).
       The atmosphere is ok but the food sucks, service (ripped burrito)
       was mediocre at best, sorry but on a food chain like Chipotle
       higher standards ARE EXPECTED.
       WARNING VIDEO IS VERY GRAFIC BUT I HAD TO SHOW THE RUBBER LIKE
       "BARBACOA".

       This is usually my preferred Chipotle location. It's located
       conveniently and doesn't get nearly as much traffic as others.  The
       lunchtime rush still happens, so if I need food between 11-1, I
       order online.
       Service is good. You generally get the same level at chains, but I
       feel like the food tends to be put together better here - maybe
       it's because they're not as rushed as others.
       As a bonus, there's free parking here.

       The food is always good and they run through the line very quickly,
       however, they seem to have a problem with cleanliness.  I've been
       here on multiple occasions and the tables and floor are always
       messy.  I work in a very high traffic bar so I understand that this
       happens from time to time and only when things are very busy.
       What I don't understand is why when this store is dirty and
       seemingly busy, there are three-four employees  taking a break and
       eating.  Everyone deserves a break, but if a protocol was in place
       that made employees buss and sweep the dining area before breaks,
       this unsightly and inconsiderate issue may be corrected.  It would
       literally take no more than 5min.  Easy fix.

       Used to pretty good service at the local Chipotle's. It's super
       busy so I'm even usually understanding of minor mess ups. I don't
       understand a bad attitude by management or the attitude like I'm
       inconveniencing when I'm returning here because your team messed up
       my order. Subpar service...I'll drive the additional minutes
       outside my route for better service.

       Chipotle is one of my favorite restaurants to go to when I have the
       time, and this satellite to the whole lives up to my every wish.
       The food is perfectly cooked (I happened to be eating 3
       soft-shelled tacos with chicken, salsa, and cheese). The minimal
       complaints I have is the line is to the door, most likely due to
       the influx of students from Maryland. The line does go much quicker
       than you might expect however. The noise can be quite loud. But
       what can you expect from a Chipotle. Overall I really enjoyed my
       food and the service was excellent.

       I've been coming to this location about 1x/week for the past year.
        Never had any issues with service or quality of food.  This
       location seems a bit small compared to other locations I've been to
       and the line can occasionally get pretty long, resulting in 20 min
       wait times.  It'd be nice if Chipotle would follow Freebird's
       approach to preparing orders, but that's clearly never going to
       happen.

       Worst chipotle I been too the staff always has an attitude, they
       give you little amounts of everything expect rice!. They rush you
       down the line even if your the only person in line.
       Yesterday at work our manger decided to buy everyone lunch and
       before really thinking about it we chose chipotle forgetting that
       the closest one to us sucks! Now it wasn't a large group of us
       ordering just 4 bowls. We placed our order online. When our food
       was finish my coworker immediately started to apologize, because my
       bowl was at the bottom and instead of just giving us 2 bags or
       packing the bag better they decided to throwing everything in
       there. So aside from the mashed bowl I open the bowl an was
       immediately in shock. Greenbelt chipotle really out did their
       selfs. Let me tell you now my bowl was very simple lettuce chicken
       light rice cheese and sour cream. When I tell you they added the
       bare minimum of each item except rice I mean it . The crazy part is
       I wrote in the details light rice. But they do the complete
       opposite and give me light everything else and heavy rice. My
       coworkers food was even worst. We work at a hotel and people ask us
       about good food places and we never recommend that chipotle we tell
       them about the bad service and poor Quality food. The workers can
       care less and it shows. It should have been a manger there to check
       the online orders to make sure stuff like this doesn't happen. But
       his or her staff probably gets the bad attitude from the manger.

       Tasty, nutritious, and gluten-free options abound!  Yes,  those of
       us with celiac disease can have a great meal here at Chipotle, just
       avoid flour tortillas.  And a big thumbs-up for the bbq meat and
       the black beans, both are so delicious!   Will be a regular
       customer henceforth,  not just on Cinco de Mayo...Viva Chipotle!

       I ordered 2 chicken tacos and a combo burrito bowl. While along the
       2nd taco she ran out of chicken. She put a little on there,
       replaced the chicken supply and forgot about my taco. I asked if I
       can have more chicken and she rolled her eyes and added ONE CUBE of
       chicken! The cashier Caitlin rang up my food I asked her if there's
       steak in my bowl cuz I didn't see it, she said yes. I pay and take
       my food only to be told that she didn't ring my tacos up. I pay
       again then sit down and dive into my burrito bowl only to realize
       there's no steak on it!!! I told her and she doesn't apologize just
       gets a small container or steak and hands it to me. I mean there
       was such a tiny bit of steak in there it was ridiculous. Why do
       these ppl act as if the meat is coming out of their paycheck?? 1st
       time here and will definitely never go back.

       This location is typically slow in serving customers so I place my
       orders online in advance and give them a few extra minutes after my
       scheduled pick up time. The last time I was here, I didn't place an
       order and waited in an extremely long line. When I got to the
       front, they were out of steak and it took foreverrrrrrrrrrr to cook
       new steak. I actually spent about 35 minutes or so inside this
       Chipotle. What I liked, however, was that manager came to me and a
       few other people who were waiting on steak and personally took our
       orders. He then made sure our orders were freshly made and gave us
       a large cup for drinks and told us everything was free. Now THAT is
       excellent customer service!

       I love Chipotle, but after seeing what a staff did at this
       Greenbelt location, this makes me question the entire
       establishment. This staff was highly unhygienic; continuously
       wiping the dirty counter with her gloved hands, then without
       changing the gloves picks  up lettuce and cheese to place on
       customers' bowls. The manager was there, and to all of them it was
       normal.  If anyone ever gets food poisoning or a case of diarrhea
       after eating from this Chipotle, well now you know why. Sometimes
       people are too busy chatting it up with friends on Chipotles' long
       lines, that we do not catch these types of disgusting staff habits.
       The sanitary thing to do is either have paper towel handing for the
       staff that they can use to wipe the counters; wiping counters with
       your hands, then touching food that people are about to eat is not
       sanitary. Or have utensils to serve all food items.

       It is a pain getting in and out of this location. The traffic is a
       hassle, the lot is a logistical mess, and it is a busy shop. You
       can expect to wait for your food. The good news is that the people
       here are very friendly, and you will not go hungry. My sofrito bowl
       was packed solid with toppings.

       I love chipotle. This place serves very low quantity when compared
       to other locations. They have to fix this soon or else people wont
       be back to this location

       In general I love Chipotle. This one has been fine most of the time
       ( though my husband has come home a number of times having told
       them he wanted cheese and sour cream and they missed putting one
       on....though my husband was standing there and missed that they
       missed it, so not sure it's all on them.) Though tonight our food
       was blah, and I finally realized the steak AND the rice had no
       salt, perhaps the salsa too! Was it so late no one felt like
       refilling the salt shaker? There is a giant across the parking lot,
       so running out isn't an excuse. That is just pure laziness in my
       book. Who thinks they can make food without salt?

       This is a Chipotle. It is more or less the same as every other
       Chipotle, and that is a good thing because the chain as a whole is
       one of the best ones out there, both in terms of store quality and
       upkeep, and their emphasis on non-GMO sustainable practices.
       The staff at this location in Greenbelt is excellent, friendly and
       inviting.
       I beg you all, if you are in the area or live around here, please
       avoid the KFC's and Popeye's of the world and instead come here for
       a high quality filling balanced meal. Heck, I ask them to hold the
       cheese and sour cream, more often than not going vegetarian, and
       make my meals here even healthy, dare I say.

       I love Chipotle.  LOVE IT.
       I've been coming to the Greenbelt location about once a week for a
       long time.  I'm noticing the portions (meat, sour cream, guac.)
       getting smaller.  If I'm paying an extra $2.15, I want a healthy
       scoop of guacamole.
       I noticed that someone was refilling the containers.  Sour cream,
       salsa, and meat was poured on top of what was there.  What happened
       to first in, first out?  Usually they replace the near empty
       container with a full one, and then put the portion from container
       A on top.  You never get old ingredients this way.
       Now to the drink station.  No ice.  And they had about 50 knives,
       but only 7 forks.
       This was 1:12 pm on 8/26/14.  I'll try again but won't keep coming
       if it stays like this.  :(
