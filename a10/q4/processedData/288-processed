   Happy Labor Day!

   I suppose we all have to start somewhere. Labor Day has me thinking
   about my first job, at the ripe age of 16.
   [INS: :INS]

   Growing up in a college town, good jobs weren’t always the easiest to
   come by. Not only were high school students competing with the more
   experienced college students for part time work in offices and
   hospitals, there was also a huge population of under-employed. That is,
   spouses of medical students, graduate students or even professors who
   had the credentials to get a “real” job but were unable to do so
   because the small college town had very little to offer outside of the
   College and Medical Field.

   As a result, my first job was in fast food.

   Rax Roast Beef to be exact.  (Though it has been over 5 years since
   I’ve had Fast Food, I’ve got to say that Rax might tempt me if it was
   still around. Though perhaps I’m romanticizing how good the sandwiches
   and shakes were.)

   You are probably expecting me to complain about it, but I loved that
   job. One of my best friends worked with me, and together we made
   friends with everyone else there. In fact, the only person I remember
   being unfriendly was the general manager. Looking back I’m sure she had
   her hands full. Babysitting a bunch of high school employees who were
   being directly managed by people in their early 20’s couldn’t have been
   easy.

   Regardless, I have many happy memories seeing how perky I could sound
   on the drive though and can remember the triumph after successfully
   begging the managers to let me work in back in food prep. (They liked
   to keep the girls up front. This was the 80’s, they had no problem
   saying “You are cute so you should be where people can see you.”)

   This also happens to be the first time I set a big savings goal for
   myself. It was the summer between my Junior and Senior year of High
   School and my Dad had a very rare business trip scheduled late August.
   (He was a government employee so this was a really big deal.)

   He was taking us with him to Atlanta and I worked my butt off that
   entire summer so that I could have money to buy clothes for my Senior
   Year.

   It’s funny how you never forget something like that.

   Once I had six month’s of work experience I immediately got a job in
   the Mall in a clothing store,  but I’ll never forget the fun times I
   had.

   Looking back, I can see I was making the very, very best of what many
   would consider a miserable job. I think I could take a lesson from
   16-year-old Wendy now when I’m fussing about cleaning the kitchen for
   the 7th time that day or reading “The Hungry Caterpillar” for the 47th
   time.  (Who else doesn’t even need the book to recite it word for
   word?)
   Slow Cooker Chipotle Meatballs - Gluten Free - WendyPolisi.com It kind
   of makes me laugh that my first job was in food.

     * 2 eggs, lightly beaten
     * 1 tablespoon chili powder
     * 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
     * 1 teaspoon garlic powder
     * 1 teaspoon cumin, divided
     * 1½ teaspoons sea salt, divided
     * 28 oz fire-roasted crushed tomatoes
