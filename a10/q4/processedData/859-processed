   We Will Never Know What Caused the Chipotle Outbreak

   The CDC’s investigation of Chipotle is over and their final verdict is
   in: The outbreak is finished, but the agency has no idea what caused
   it.

   So...what exactly does that mean?

   The [37]CDC shut down the investigation early this afternoon, saying
   that it had been two months since the last confirmed case of E. Coli
   linked to Chipotle and the outbreak appeared to be over. What the news
   didn’t come with was any determination of what was behind the outbreak.
   Investigators still believe it came down to a single ingredient, but
   what that ingredient was remains a mystery—one the CDC doesn’t expect
   to be solved.

   So how do you close an investigation without knowing what
   happened?Essentially, there are a couple different an investigation
   like this one can end. The most satisfying way is, of course, to find
   the cause. But sometimes, when no cause is found, an investigation can
   end when the outbreak has.

   In this case—despite genome sequencing of the bacteria, data analysis,
   and frequent kitchen testing—the contaminated ingredient remained
   elusive. Although that may seem alarming, not knowing the cause in
   food-borne outbreaks is actually quite common, and there are some good
   reasons why, according to Michael Doyle, a professor of food
   microbiology at the University of Georgia.

   “It’s frequent,” Doyle told Gizmodo, “in large part because not all
   outbreaks can be fully investigated because there’s so many thousand or
   more a year.” Of course, some of the problem is [44]specifically to do
   with E. Coli being a notoriously difficult bacteria to track, due to
   the long gap between when you eat it and when you get sick. That was
   one reason the CDC waited so long after the last known case—it takes at
   least three weeks to confirm a case, and often longer than that.

   But if the outbreak has stopped, as the CDC says it has, is not knowing
   the source really a problem? It is—especially when it comes to
   predicting future outbreaks.

   “Certainly the top priority is to stop the outbreak,” Doyle said, “but
   the value of knowing the source is being able to trace it further and
   stop it there. They are able to find the source in many cases and
   there’s a long list of foods that are now recognized as being the
   vehicles in food-borne outbreaks.”

   With this investigation closed, and the outbreak hopefully over, the
   cause of Chipotle’s particular strain of E. Coli looks likely to always
   remain a mystery. [45]Enjoy that burrito!
