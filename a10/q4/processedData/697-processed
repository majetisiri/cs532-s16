Here's How You 'Summon' Your Tesla Model S Using Your Apple Watch

   Tesla Model S

   Tesla Model S owner demonstrated the Summon feature using an Apple
   Watch. The Summon feature can open the garage door, park itself and
   shut down without a driver in the car.

   In January 2016, Tesla released a new version of [84]Autopilot that now
   includes a feature called Summon, which allows Model S owners to
   remotely move their vehicle with a smartwatch or a smartphone.

   Tesla says that with Summon, owners can perform some limited function
   on their Tesla vehicles but in the future the company may expand the
   utility of the feature.

   "Using Summon, once you arrive home and exit Model S or Model X, you
   can prompt it to do the rest: open your garage door, enter your garage,
   park itself, and shut down. In the morning, you wake up, walk out the
   front door, and summon your car. It will open the garage door and come
   to greet you," [85]said Tesla.

   Now, Allen Wong of Rego app has updated the Remote S for Tesla app that
   allows the electric car owners to use the Summon feature with their
   Apple Watch. YouTuber Mark Schey has also demonstrated the Summon
   feature using the Apple Watch.

   "Using an Apple Watch, you can have your Tesla open the garage door and
   autonomously pull out of the garage. The Summon feature is 100%
   initiated by Remote S on the Apple Watch. If you want it to work
   without the keyfob nearby, you need to first trigger the 'Keyless
   Start' in the app," says Schey.

   A Tesla car with the Autopilot hardware should be in the range of 39
   feet to use the Summon feature. However, Wong says that this limitation
   is not present while using the Remote S app.

   "Try using the remote/keyless start on your car via Remote S (iPhone or
   Apple Watch). This will allow you to bypass the requirement for having
   the keyfob nearby the car. This will also mean that you can summon the
   car without physically being near the car at all," says Wong.

   The Summon feature brings Tesla a step closer in developing a car,
   which can be driven with a mobile scene. Interestingly, James Bond film
   released in 1997 "Tomorrow Never Dies " shows a car chase scene where
   Agent 007 (Pierce Brosnan) summons his BMW with his phone and controls
   it while sitting at the back.

   Currently, the Summon feature of Tesla vehicles can only be used only
   on private property. However, in the future owners of Tesla cars may be
   able to use the feature to execute complex functions even out with
   private space.

   Check out a short video of how Schey summons the Model S.
