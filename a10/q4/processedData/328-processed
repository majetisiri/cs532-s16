After weathering outbreaks of E. Coli, salmonella and norovirus in its
restaurants, there is now a lettuce shortage at Chipotles around New York
City.

   Lettuce pray!

   After weathering outbreaks of E. Coli, salmonella and norovirus in its
   restaurants — Chipotle has turned over a new leaf and now there’s none
   left for customers in New York.

   “We have a lettuce shortage in the city at the moment,” an employee at
   the Maiden Lane location told the Daily News.

   And at another downtown location, a counter person was overheard
   telling a shocked customer, “You’re getting the last lettuce in New
   York.”

   The lack of green is the latest dilemma for the plagued Mexican fast
   food chain. City locations from Midtown to Battery Park also reported
   to have run low on the salad staple that’s tossed into its burritos,
   tacos and bowls.

   The low-levels of leafy vegetables are likely a result of the stricter
   standards the restaurant is adhering to in the wake of the outbreaks
   that shuttered stores across the nation earlier last month.

“We have a lettuce shortage in the city at the moment,” an employee at the
Maiden Lane location told the Daily News.

   Chipotle staffers now prepare lettuce in a central kitchen so it can be
   tested and then ship the verified veggies out to individual
   restaurants.

   Thursday’s lettuce lapse was even more noticeable because in many
   locations neighboring restaurants, like Chop’t, had plenty of green.

   By the late afternoon, the East Broad St. location was down to a
   handful of lettuce leaves.

   “Right now we only have two bags,” said an employee.

   Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold admitted that there was a salad
   shortage at the chain’s New York city locations and chalked the issue
   up to an “ordering glitch.”

   “There is more lettuce arriving for those restaurants this evening and
   the restaurants should be resupplied accordingly,” he said.

   There are 63 Chipotle restaurants in New York City.
