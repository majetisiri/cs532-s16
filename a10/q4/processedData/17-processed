Dos Locos: The next best thing to Chipotle arriving in Shanghai

   doslocosburrito2.jpg

   The latest project by the Piro guys, Dos Locos might remind Americans
   of US Mexican-American chain, [17]Chipotle. And by that, we mean it's
   almost a carbon copy from the red menu display on the wall, to the
   bulging, duffel-like burritos with flavors like barbacoa beef and pork
   carnitas, to identical condiments. However, unlike other China
   knockoffs which simply ape the layout, Dos Locos tries capturing the
   spirit of the original by ditching the additives and using top-shelf
   ingredients like free-range chicken. For the most part, it succeeds.

   Its authenticity can be attributed to Chinese-American owner Charles
   Zeng doing his research aka eating mountains of Chipotle while working
   mergers and acquisitions in NY.

   Service

   You order up front on the right, and the guy behind the glass compiles
   your burrito to your specifications, moving it down the counter like an
   assembly line. You pay the cashier on the left. However, we've heard
   through the grapevine that they might change the format to sit-down to
   accommodate Chinese customers.

   We found Dos Locos' staff exuberant and spunky, all too rare a breed in
   Shanghai.

   Food
   doslocoschips2.jpg
   Chips and guacamole
   Burritos are Dos Locos' lifeblood. They offer four flavors: grilled
   chicken (55RMB), beef barbacoa (65RMB), pork carnitas (55RMB), and
   vegetarian (55RMB). You choose from a selection of condiments,
   including either brown rice or cilantro lime rice, bacon-baked pinto
   beans or vegetarian kidney beans, and then guacamole, cheddar cheese,
   sour cream, and a trio of salsas.

   They also offer a burrito bowl, basically the contents of your burrito
   over rice without a tortilla. We advise against it. While at Chipotle,
   the ingredients are fresh and colorful enough to hold their own, Dos
   Locos' are slightly more monochromatic; the beans taste blander, the
   pork's drier, and the guac, despite using the same Hass avocados, lacks
   some butteriness. They need the tortilla to bind them together. But
   when it does, enter one of the better bundles of meat, veg, and cheese
   in Shanghai.

   Also don't miss the pot brownies (20RMB). No, they don't contain pot,
   but the lush, earthy fudge makes up for it.

   Unfortunately, there's no Negro Modelo or signature margarita to wash
   it all down, but they do offer Delirium Tremens (55RMB), Brooklyn IPA
   (45RMB), and one of our favorites, Rogue Dead Guy Ale (45RMB), along
   with the obligatory Corona (25RMB) and Dos Equis (35RMB).

   Final thoughts

   doslocosinterior2.jpg Whether you're looking for edible
   Mexican-American in Shanghai or missing your favorite red and brown
   burrito chain, Dos Locos massages the spot, despite a few rough
   patches.
