Black Bean Soup 600 g black beans, soaked overnight (~ 300 g dried beans) 2
tablespoons olive oil 1 onion, finely chopped 3 garlic cloves , crushed 1
dried chili pepper (optional) ¼ teaspoon ground chili 2 teaspoons ground
cumin 1.2 l vegetable or chicken broth juice of 1 lemon salt and freshly
ground black pepper 5 tablespoons sour cream chopped fresh coriander Drain
soaked beans, place in a large pot, add cold water and bring to a boil. Cook
for 10 minutes on high heat, skim the foam that rises to the top of the pot,
lower heat and simmer for 1 hour or until beans are tender. When beans are
done, drain them. In a large pot over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the
onions, crushed garlic and sauté until softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the
chillies to taste, cumin, beans and broth. Bring to the boil and simmer on
low heat for about 10 minutes. In a blender or food processor, puree the soup
in batches, leaving some texture, and return the soup to the pot.
Alternatively, process with a handheld blender in the pot until the desired
consistency is reached. Add the lemon juice If the soup is too thick, thin it
with water. Reheat gently over medium heat. Season with salt and pepper.
Ladle the soup into warmed bowls and garnish each bowl with sour cream,
crushed nachos and chopped parsley (or coriander if you like it).
