   [83]Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.’s 1,971 restaurants in the U.S. are
   scheduled to close for lunch on Monday for a companywide meeting that
   will be part update on new food-safety protocols and part rally to
   prepare for the return of customers.

   [84]Multiple foodborne illness outbreaks in the latter half of fiscal
   2015 resulted in a dismal fourth quarter for the Denver-based chain,
   including a 30-percent decline in same-store sales during December,
   followed by an even worse 36-percent decline in January, the company
   said.

   When restaurants across the country reopen at 3 p.m. local time on
   Monday, however, company officials hope a new era will begin for the
   fast-casual chain.

   On deck is the largest marketing campaign in Chipotle’s history that
   will include significant use of freebies and discounts. Messaging will
   return to a focus on the taste of Chipotle’s food and use of quality
   ingredients.

   “As we emerge from this difficult time, we can focus on what will be
   our primary objective for 2016: Making sure our food is as safe as
   possible and welcoming customers back to our restaurants as our teams
   deliver an extraordinary dining experience,” said Steve Ells, founder,
   chairman and co-CEO in a recent call with Wall Street analysts.

   Monty Moran, Chipotle co-CEO, said the companywide meeting is “an
   opportunity for us to describe in detail to our whole team all of the
   steps that we have taken to make our food safer before it ever arrives
   at the restaurants, as well as to highlight and explain the reasons
   behind some of the new procedures that have already been implemented.”

   The new food-safety protocols also include an aspect of accountability.

   Field leaders now audit every restaurant on a weekly basis, Moran said.
   In addition, restaurants will be subject to quarterly audits by a
   third-party vendor, which the company did not identify.

   This year, those third-party audit scores will account for half of
   manager bonuses, he said. The other half will be tied to customer
   service as the chain welcomes customers back.

   “We believe this compensation realignment will further underscore for
   our managers and teams just how important it is to properly execute our
   food-safety procedures, and all of this will help us in establishing a
   heightened culture of food safety in all of our restaurants,” Moran
   said.

   The foodborne illness crisis has not impacted turnover among the
   chain’s nearly 60,000 workers, he noted, adding that “we’re very, very
   proud of our restaurant teams.”

   Moran said Chipotle’s employees are “super enthusiastic, very
   understanding of what we’re asking them to do and very, very competent
   in getting it done, even though we’ve made quite a few changes in a
   pretty short period of time.”

   Some changes have riled customers, such as the removal of fresh lemons
   from drink stations. Now the chain offers lemons on request.

   Such changes are also likely to be explained with the launch of a new
   website on Monday that will communicate Chipotle’s ongoing commitment
   to food safety, as it attempts to bring the risk of another foodborne
   illness outbreak to as near zero as possible.

   In its annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
   on Friday, Chipotle warned of the challenges ahead, saying sales are
   expected to improve now that the Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention declared the recent E. coli outbreaks over.

   The brand, however, “will need to re-establish customer trust in light
   of the food safety incidents that negatively impacted us beginning in
   the fourth quarter of 2015, and doing so in the competitive environment
   in which we operate will be one of our key challenges in 2016 and
   beyond.”

   The foodborne illness incidents resulted in $16 million in
   non-recurring expenses, including the cost of throwing out food,
   impairment charges for kitchen equipment that will no longer be used,
   insurance claim estimates, increased marketing expenses, lab analysis
   of food samples and swabs, and the hiring of food-safety advisors, the
   report said.

   Chipotle’s average unit volume for 2015 declined to $2.42 million,
   compared with $2.47 million the prior year, though the outbreaks mostly
   impacted only the last two months of the year.

   The 0.2-percent same-store sales increase for the year included a
   3.5-percent increase attributed to menu price increases that was offset
   by lower transactions and group size, mostly in the fourth quarter.

   In listing risk factors, which for any public company typically include
   worst-case scenarios, Chipotle warned that it may never recover sales
   to levels before the outbreaks hit the news.

   The brand was particularly vulnerable, in part because customers had
   higher expectations as a result of its Food With Integrity promise, but
   also because social media likely raised awareness of the outbreak — and
   will exacerbate the impact of any potential outbreak in future.

   Chipotle also cited among its risk factors the impact of numerous
   lawsuits filed by customers that were sickened in the outbreaks, as
   well as a class-action lawsuit filed by shareholders tied to the
   decline in stock price.

   The company also cited the widened criminal investigation into its
   food-safety practices. Publicity of the legal proceedings could
   continue to hamper Chipotle’s ability to regain lost sales and attract
   new customers, the report said.

   Expanding catering may also be a risk, given that food would be served
   in conditions the company cannot control.

   “Even if foodborne illnesses arise from conditions outside our control,
   the negative impact from any such illnesses is likely to be
   significant,” Chipotle said.
