A FOCUS ON FOOD SAFETY

   Since we opened the first Chipotle restaurant more than 22 years ago,
   we have served fresh, wholesome ingredients prepared using classic
   cooking techniques. It’s always been a top priority to make sure that
   our delicious food is safe to eat.

   Ensuring that all of our fresh ingredients are as safe as possible is a
   serious effort. Not only do we need to work closely with our suppliers
   to ensure that the ingredients we buy are safe, but we also need to
   make sure that once those ingredients reach our restaurants, they are
   handled and prepared in the safest way possible. Explore this page to
   learn about how we do that.

OUR FOOD SAFETY PROCEDURES

   1

AT OUR SUPPLIERS:

   Like all restaurant companies, we buy the ingredients we use from a
   variety of different farmers, ranchers, and other producers. Many of
   those suppliers are in the United States, but some ingredients, like
   avocados, sometimes come from other countries. To ensure that the
   ingredients we buy are safe—meaning they are not contaminated with
   germs that could make people sick—we have established strict guidelines
   and procedures that our suppliers must follow.

   Some of the ingredients we buy are delivered directly to our
   restaurants and others are sent first to central kitchens where they
   are washed and tested again before being sent to our restaurants. Below
   you will find descriptions of some of the procedures we use to ensure
   that our ingredients are safe both at the farms where they are raised
   as well as at the central kitchens where they are prepped.

HIGH-RESOLUTION TESTING

   The farms and central kitchens that raise and prepare our ingredients
   test those ingredients using high-resolution methods. High resolution
   testing is the practice of taking a large number of samples from a
   relatively small amount of the ingredient. This type of testing
   substantially reduces the risk that unsafe cilantro will go undetected.

   For example, the cilantro we use gets tested twice — once in the field
   before harvest and again after it’s cleaned and ready to be packed. In
   the field, trained food safety professionals collect samples from each
   cilantro field following a “Z” pattern to ensure that the sample is
   both representative and statistically random. A field can only be
   harvested after the samples taken from it pass our tests.

   After harvest, the cilantro is cleaned and tested again before being
   packed. Just as in the case of field testing, the packed cilantro is
   only shipped to Chipotle restaurants once they have passed the test.

INGREDIENTS FROM CENTRAL KITCHENS

   To ensure that all of the food we serve is as safe as possible, we
   prepare some items in central kitchens. Preparing ingredients in
   central kitchens helps ensure they’re free of germs, and reduces the
   chance that they could pick up any other germs while being prepped in
   the restaurants.

   Tomatoes are a great example. Until recently, we diced tomatoes at our
   restaurants. Because we use up to five cases of tomatoes a day at each
   Chipotle, it wouldn’t be practical to individually test each tomato
   after washing and before dicing.

HERE'S HOW WE ENSURE TOMATOES ARE SAFE AT THE CENTRAL KITCHEN:

   tomato and water

1. TOMATOES ARE WASHED

   cut tomato

2. THEN DICED

   cut tomato and water

3. AND THEN RINSED UNDER STRICT SUPERVISION

   bin of diced tomatoes

4. NEXT, HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUAL PIECES OF TOMATO ARE TESTED

   a rejected bin

5. IF ANY FAIL—THE ENTIRE BATCH IS REJECTED

   an accepted bin

6. IF ALL PASS, THE TOMATOES ARE USED AT THE RESTAURANT

   We apply this same meticulous process to many of our ingredients, such
   as beef, romaine lettuce, and bell peppers.

IN OUR RESTAURANTS:

   From the kitchen to the dining room, a Chipotle restaurant is a busy
   place. Given all of the activity that takes place in each
   restaurant—from our teams who prepare and serve food to our customers
   who spend time enjoying the restaurant experience—ensuring that the
   food and environment are as safe as possible is essential.

   That’s why we have developed a set of procedures that make safety the
   highest priority in our restaurants. These procedures dictate how
   ingredients are handled, stored, and prepared; how restaurants are
   cleaned; and how our employees are trained. Below are descriptions of
   the key procedures:
     * chicken

MARINATE CHICKEN ONLY AT NIGHT
       Chicken is marinated only at the end of the night—after other fresh
       ingredients have been prepped and put away. This procedure is
       important because raw meats can have germs on them that might come
       in contact with other ingredients.
     * Blanching veges

PRODUCE BLANCHING
       We blanch our lemons, limes, jalapeños, onions, and avocados,
       submerging them in boiling water for five seconds, making them
       safer by dramatically reducing—or even eliminating—germs on their
       skins. This does not affect flavor.
     * Cleaning checklist

HEIGHTENED RESTAURANT SANITATION
       We also require a comprehensive range of cleaning and sanitizing
       protocols, such as:
          + High frequency of cleaning and sanitizing high-contact areas
            during service
          + Restaurant-wide cleaning and sanitizing procedures at the end
            of each day
     * Restaurant audits

AUDITS & INSPECTIONS
       We follow a rigorous restaurant inspection program:
          + Weekly inspections by Chipotle field leaders trained in food
            safety
          + Multiple annual inspections by Chipotle corporate food safety
            team
          + Frequent inspections by independent restaurant health experts
          + Regular inspections by local government health officials
     * Increased sick leave and rewards

EMPLOYEE WELLNESS AND INCENTIVE STRUCTURE
       Our teams are trained and evaluated to ensure that food safety is
       their top priority.
          + Our paid sick leave program—one of the few such policies to
            exist at a national restaurant chain—enables workers to stay
            home when they are not well. In addition to offering regular
            sick days, we also have programs to extend sick leave when
            circumstances warrant.
          + Our incentive structure rewards restaurants that score well on
            food safety
          + The senior manager on duty during each shift is designated
            “food safety owner” responsible for checking that all
            procedures are carefully followed

OUR COMMITMENT TO FOOD WITH INTEGRITY:

   Our commitment to Food With Integrity is stronger than ever. We believe
   that the safest and most delicious food comes when the best ingredients
   are prepared simply, using classic cooking techniques. When developing
   our food safety procedures, we took great care to ensure that the taste
   of our food remains as delicious as ever.

THAT'S WHY YOU SEE PLENTY OF COOKING AT YOUR LOCAL CHIPOTLE, SUCH AS:

   cooked steak

MARINATING AND GRILLING CHICKEN AND STEAK

   cooked steak

DICING ONIONS AND JALAPEÑOS

   cooked steak

CHOPPING CILANTRO

   cooked steak

COOKING RICE

   cooked steak

PREPARING FRESH GUACAMOLE

   None of these procedures interfere with the great taste of the food at
   Chipotle. In fact, some even make the food more delicious. For example,
   our process for preparing items like fresh tomato salsa and guacamole
   involves mixing the diced aromatics (like onions and jalapeños) in
   citrus juice before adding the other ingredients—a process also known
   as “maceration”. While this serves as an additional food safety step,
   it also results in ingredients that taste even brighter and fresher.

OUR $10 MILLION LOCAL GROWERS SUPPORT INITIATIVE

   We’re also committed to sourcing fresh produce from local farms,
   because they’re a big part of what we do.

   In 2015, Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. served more than 30 million
   pounds of produce sourced from local farmers—or about 12% of the fresh
   produce brought into our restaurants. But for some of the smaller
   farmers in our local produce program, implementing Chipotle’s food
   safety standards may be a challenge. Some of these growers don’t have
   the financial resources, personnel, or technology necessary to meet
   Chipotle’s new safety standards.

   That’s why we created the Chipotle Local Grower Support Initiative.
   We’re committing up to $10 million to help our suppliers meet our new
   safety standards. Not only is this good for our suppliers, it will help
   to ensure that our customers have access to an even larger supply of
   fresh and safe local produce. These funds will enable us to support
   some of the best local growers around the country—from small- and
   medium-sized local growers to farmers who use techniques like
   greenhouses.

   This program will focus on three key objectives:
     * Education and training: Provide the food safety support and
       education necessary to meet our standards and help offset the costs
       of enhanced testing and food safety practices.
     * Financial assistance: Provide financial assistance in the form of
       grants or premiums to help cover the higher costs of enhanced food
       safety practices.
     * Develop new partnerships: Seek out farmers using greenhouses and
       other technologies around the country that meet Chipotle’s food
       safety standards.
