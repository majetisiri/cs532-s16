The CDC Can’t Figure Out What Caused Chipotle’s E. Coli Outbreaks

   The official investigation is now closed.

   After months of turmoil, Chipotle marked another step toward
   burrito-bowl normalcy on Monday: The Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention said it has [46]closed its investigation into the two E.
   coli outbreaks that originated at the chain. An update on the agency’s
   website read, “These two outbreaks appear to be over.”

   Since October, illnesses have been reported in 14 states between the
   two outbreaks—60 people were sickened, with 22 hospitalized and no
   deaths.

   According to the CDC, “A common meal item or ingredient served at
   Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants was a likely source of both
   outbreaks,” but with the case closed and the source eluding
   investigators since October, it’s unlikely that the culprit or culprits
   will be found.

   Chipotle’s stock price, which dropped by 30 percent in the wake of the
   outbreaks, was up by nearly 4 percent Monday morning. “We are pleased
   that the CDC has concluded its investigation, and we have offered our
   full cooperation throughout,” Chris Arnold, a Chipotle spokesman, said
   in a statement.

   With its efforts to overhaul food-safety protocols, give away burritos,
   and make Chipotle “the safest place to eat”—as CEO Steve Ells said on
   Today in December—the chain has been trying for months to move on from
   its food-safety crisis. But even with the end of the CDC investigation,
   Chipotle hasn’t seen the end of its trouble. There are multiple
   [47]class-action lawsuits from victims of the E. coli, norovirus, and
   salmonella outbreaks, as well as a suit filed by investors alleging
   that the chain [48]misled stockholders about its food-safety protocols.
   Then there’s the ongoing [49]federal criminal investigation surrounding
   the norovirus outbreak in California.
