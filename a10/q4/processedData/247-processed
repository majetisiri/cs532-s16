Social Recruitment Strategy: Three Companies to Learn From - Chipotle

   by [34]Lindsay Shoemake, JWT INSIDE Account Coordinator

   on 03 March 2014 at 16:32

   Last time we discussed [35]ANN INC.’s dynamic and identity-driven
   social recruitment strategy; now, we’re venturing into the spicy social
   recruitment realm of [36]Chipotle, famed fast-casual restaurant brand
   and down-home burrito joint.

   [37]Chipotle Careers’ recruitment strategy is just as straightforward
   as its food. With consistent messaging that encourages job seekers to
   “start your career rolling” and “join Chipotle’s people culture,” the
   brand’s social recruitment strategy hinges on exactly what matters most
   in the hiring process – the people.

   Let’s take a closer look and explore how Chipotle Careers expertly
   leverages its social strategy – I had the unique opportunity to chat
   with the brand’s Recruitment Communications lead via email, who shared
   valuable insights on how to attract, retain and grow the best talent
   for its growing restaurant base and corporate positions.

   Every career has a story.
   With one visit to Chipotle Careers’ [38]recruitment site, it’s evident
   that the people are the most important part of the company. The site
   illustrates this in its [39]“Real Stories” section, which features the
   unique success stories of restaurant associates who have climbed the
   ranks of the company. This page is dynamic in that it is completely
   reflective of Chipotle’s unique and diverse “people culture.”

   “Chipotle has an amazing people culture built on hiring top performing
   employees, developing and empowering them to deliver an exceptional
   dining experience for our customers,” Chipotle Recruitment
   Communications Specialist Jen Gamarano said. “Much of our employment
   brand strategy is built around conveying that message to job seekers by
   allowing our employees to share their stories. We are not only in the
   food business, we are in the business of changing people’s lives for
   the better and social media is a great platform for us to deliver that
   message.”

   Another added value of the site? It allows applicants to track the
   status of their [40]employment applications, keeping them in the loop
   on every step of the hiring process.

   Get the conversation flowing organically.
   Chipotle has long been hailed as a leader in creative social media
   endeavors (remember when they[41] hacked their own Twitter account in
   2013?), and the brand’s recruitment-specific Twitter account,
   [42]@Chipotle[43]Jobs, follows suit. @ChipotleJobs is an expert social
   listener and makes an active effort to [44]follow up with each of its
   applicants who mention the account – fostering a valuable
   brand-employer connection early in the hiring game.

   “Social media is a great way for us to reach an audience of passive
   candidates that otherwise would not be actively searching for or
   applying for a new job,” Gamarano said. “It has provided us with an
   opportunity to engage directly with candidates to answer questions they
   might have before applying or during the interview process and has
   proven to be a great resource for generating employee referrals.”

    In addition, the Twitter account consistently implements relevant and
   location-specific hashtags, including #Chipotle, #recruiters, #quality
   and more. As if all of these engagement tactics weren’t enough,
   compelling and recruitment-specific graphics are also used on Twitter
   to direct applicants to Chipotle’s careers [45]website.
   How would Chipotle’s recruitment team describe its people culture in
   140 characters or less? “A people culture as unique and incredible as
   your burrito. #unburritableworkplace,” according to Gamarano.
   Note: while writing this post I tweeted @ChipotleTweets and
   @ChipotleJobs, and they fired back a signature snarky @reply within
   minutes. Talk about great social media management!

   Giving a face to corporate is a priority.
   At Chipotle, transparency between its corporate and restaurant
   employees is valued and highly encouraged. Chipotle Careers’
   [46]Facebook account takes advantage of its timeline in a smart way,
   publishing mini-interviews with company thought-leaders and restaurant
   employees alike. In addition, the account’s timeline is consistently
   updated in real-time as new positions open, which is a feat in and of
   itself – a new Chipotle restaurant opens every two days in the U.S.!

   You’ll know what it’s like working at Chipotle before your first day.
   Chipotle Careers’ [47]YouTube channel is a visual storyboard mecca for
   potential hires. The account’s [48]“A Day in the Life” video paints an
   enticing narrative of what it’s like working in a Chipotle restaurant,
   and also educates its viewers on the brand’s business model and future
   management opportunities. A 2-minute video packs a punch with valuable
   insights and a human connection – isn’t social media all about
   connections, anyway? Kudos, Chipotle.
   [296g3kj.jpg]
   Other notable Chipotle social media accounts include
   their [49]Instagram and [50]Pinterest; although they don’t speak
   directly to recruitment, both are excellent visual tools for engagement
   and education on the brand. Keep up with Chipotle’s social recruitment
   endeavors here:

   - [52]Twitter

   - [54]YouTube

   Recruitment Strategy: Three Companies to Learn From” series.
