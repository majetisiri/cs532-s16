[32]NEW TOOL TO CALCULATE THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT

     * [33]March 17, 2016 – 6:33 pm
     * Posted in [34]Onyx Solar
     * [35]Leave a Comment

Onyx Solar^® has developed a new tool to calculate the ROI in different
cities around the world.


   ROI EN It is as easy as choosing a city, a technology (crystalline or
   amorphous silicon), and a constructive solution (curtain wall, full
   envelope or skylight) to get the return on investment and the CO[2]
   emissions avoided.

   You could find this useful app on our [36]website, or download it for
   free in Apple Store or Play Store. Check the results anywhere with your
   smartphone.

   You could find the complete Feasibility Studies of your city in this
   [37]map.

[42]NEW PHOTOVOLTAIC GLASS PROJECT IN THE CANARY ISLANDS

     * [43]March 17, 2016 – 6:31 pm
     * Posted in [44]Onyx Solar
     * [45]Leave a Comment

ICSE building, the first Canarian building to receive a LEED Platinum
certificate, has integrated Onyx Solar^® photovoltaic glass.


   ICSE Onyx Solar^® has integrated its amorphous silicon photovoltaic
   glass vertically into the mosaic façade. This triple-laminated glass,
   nearly three meters long and half a meter wide, has a 20%
   semi-transparency degree.

   This type of glass is optimal for warm climates since it filters out
   most of UV and IR radiation and prevents the overheating of the
   interior, due to an optimal Solar Factor (g).
