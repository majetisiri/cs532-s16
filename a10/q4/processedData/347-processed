   This recipe came from [20]http://www.farmgirlgourmet.com/2013/0...
   Here is the recipe:
   1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided
   1 1/2 cups diced onion
   2 14.5-ounce cans no-salt-added diced tomatoes (or home canned)
   1/2 15-ounce can no-salt-added navy beans, drained and rinsed
   1 medium chipotle chile pepper
   2 teaspoons adobo sauce (from canned chipotle chiles)
   2 ounces light cream cheese, tub style, cut into small pieces (I used
   fat-free)
   1/2 teaspoon salt
   1 cup fat-free half and half
   1/2 cup fat-free sour cream
   --Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large saucepan.
   --Cook onion until beginning to lightly brown, about 4 minutes,
   stirring frequently. Stir in the tomatoes, beans, chipotle pepper, and
   sauce. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce heat, cover and simmer 25
   minutes, or until onions are very tender; remove from heat.
   --Working in batches, puree the tomato mixture in a blender (be sure to
   hold down lid). Return to saucepan.
   --Whisk in the half-and-half and cream cheese. Place over medium heat
   and cook until heated through and cheese has melted.
   --Remove from heat, stir in the salt and remaining 2 teaspoons oil.
   Serve topped with sour cream.
