[20]Has Chipotle been hit with corporate sabotage?

   Stranger things have happened….
   MCM
     __________________________________________________________________

   From Richard Lamm;

   I and a few of my Voting Rights Task Force activists ate at a Chipotle
   in downtown SF last night.  My wife and I every Monday morning pick up
   bags of cooked, chopped up and well-seasoned meats that were left-over
   from the prior weekend to bring to a Church hall venue very near UC
   Berkeley that serves homeless youth a good hot meal and offers other
   services also every Monday evening during the school year.
   We really like Chipotle and appreciate that they are the only fast-food
   nation-wide chain that serves healthy and non-GMO food.  I think there
   is something to this story, and am sure that there is very little that
   Monsanto wouldn’t  do, criminally, to push their agenda.  If they are
   willing to be involved in the suicides of hundreds of thousands of poor
   farmers in India, what’s a little e.coli sabotage of a restaurant chain
   serving non-GMO foods?
     __________________________________________________________________

   ANALYSIS: Chipotle is a victim of corporate sabotage… biotech industry
   food terrorists are planting e.coli in retaliation for restaurant’s
   anti-GMO menu

    By MIKE ADAMS

   (NaturalNews) After observing recent events involving Chipotle and
   e.coli, here’s my analysis of the situation: Chipotle’s e.coli
   outbreaks are not random chance. They are the result of the biotech
   industry unleashing bioterrorism attacks against [21]the only fast food
   company that has publicly denounced GMOs.
