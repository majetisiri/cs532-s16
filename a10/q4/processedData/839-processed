An angry blog post cost one man his Tesla Model X reservation

   After expressing his displeasure with a preview for the electric SUV, a
   man claims Tesla canceled his order.

   Cars are Andrew's jam, as is strawberry. He started his auto-industry
   career working as a photographer and social media coordinator for Fluid
   MotorUnion, a prominent aftermarket parts fabrication garage for
   late-model European vehicles. That led to a job writing freelance
   features for "Total 911: The Porsche Magazine." His most recent job
   prior to CNET was Senior Writer for Web2Carz.com, where he helped tweak
   and develop the buying-and-selling site's editorial department, which
   brings us to today. One day, he'll buy the 1988 911 SC of his dreams.

   To be fair, the title is a little on the harsh side.

   "We reserve the right to refuse service to anybody" is a sign you might
   often see posted at local businesses, but it's one that might not get
   used every day. It appears Tesla has exercised its ability to do
   exactly that, canceling a Model X reservation for one especially
   outspoken gentleman.

   Stewart Alsop, a venture capitalist and former member of the press,
   attended a preview event for the Model X. After a long wait without
   seat time (or, as Alsop says, "real food during dinner time"), he left
   the event unhappy and [15]penned a post on Medium expressing his
   distaste.

   Evidently, that post caught Musk's attention, and after the two shared
   a phone call (according to Alsop), the future owner found himself with
   a canceled reservation. Alsop followed that [16]with another Medium
   post, again calling the company out for a wide variety of things. It's
   a fair reason to be unhappy.

   Musk, never one to shy away from doing things a bit, uh, differently,
   more or less confirmed pulling the carpet out from underneath Alsop and
   his desire to own one of Tesla's electric crossovers:

     Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer
     gets this much attention
     — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) [17]February 3, 2016

   Typically, when a writer is displeased with the service at an
   automotive event, it just [18]ends up on Jalopnik. This brouhaha is on
   another level, and while the company did nothing illegal, it's a unique
   move for an automaker trying to drum up support for a forthcoming new
   model.
