Chipotle’s customers have been poisoned? Tell us something we didn’t already
know

   US Outlook: For Chipotle it has been nothing short of a disaster,
   leading to empty stores, a collapse in revenue and corporate panic
     * [144]Andrew Dewson

   front of Congress on Thursday Reuters

   There are few things Americans love more than fast food and conspiracy
   theories. What could be more American than a Big Mac and moon landing
   hoax combo? Aside from Coca- Cola, no company has attracted more
   tinfoil hats than McDonald’s, although even the Golden Arches has so
   far not managed to combine the two. So in that sense Chipotle Mexican
   Grill, the Denver-based “fast casual” burrito dining chain, has
   achieved an unwanted first.

   Until last October, almost nothing was going wrong for Chipotle. Its
   growth appeared unstoppable, rivalled only by the fundamentalist
   Christian fried chicken sandwich chain Chic-fil-A. Then along came an
   outbreak of E.coli, which is never good for business, no matter what
   business. Customers began getting sick in California but before long
   people in 11 states were taken ill.

   For Chipotle it has been nothing short of a disaster, leading to empty
   stores, a collapse in revenue and corporate panic the like of which has
   not been seen since Enron was properly audited. The company reported
   fourth-quarter numbers on Wednesday, and they were even worse than
   expected. Sales declined by 36 per cent in January alone, not helped by
   a second poisoning outbreak – this time a norovirus traced to a
   location in Boston. Stores are opening four hours later than usual on
   Monday to train staff on food safety; better late than never, I
   suppose.

   Chipotle’s two chief executives, Steve Ells and Montgomery Moran – who
   between them took home a fraction short of $100m (£70m) last year – are
   not surprisingly feeling a little bit beaten up. Grim sales numbers
   were expected, but a widening criminal investigation was not. The
   shares, which were trading at almost $750 a piece in August, have lost
   almost 40 per cent of their value.

   Rumours about Chipotle’s food-safety practices have done the rounds for
   years, including a widely circulated but patently false accusation that
   the company served its customers dog meat. The new conspiracy theory,
   gathering pace in the US, is that Chipotle is the victim of corporate
   sabotage – that its stores were poisoned by agents of the biotech
   industry as revenge for Chipotle’s stance against using genetically
   modified ingredients.

     * 1/31 Comcast ‘in talks to buy DreamWorks for $3bn’ - Wednesday
       April 27
       Comcast, the parent of Universal Pictures, is in talks to acquire
       DreamWorks Animation for more than $3 billion, the Wall Street
       Journal reported, citing people familiar with the discussions.
       Buying the maker of the "Shrek" and "Kung Fu Panda" movies would
       bolster Comcast's collection of animated films as the largest US
       cable provider searches for ways to grow amid a trend of
       cord-cutters dropping TV for online video services like Netflix.

       Scottish Power has agreed to pay £18 million for failing to treat
       its customers fairly. The fine – of which up to £15 million will be
       paid to vulnerable Scottish Power customers and £3 million to
       charity - is the third biggest penalty given to one of the major
       six energy providers. It follows an investigation by the industry
       regulator Ofgem into the firm’s customer service.

       BHS has filed for administration, putting 11,000 jobs at risk.
       Administrators Philip Duffy and Benjamin Wiles of Duff & Phelps
       said BHS had “no alternative but to put the group into

       Artist JMW Turner and his painting The Fighting Temeraire will
       feature on the new design of the Bank of England's £20 note to
       enter circulation in 2020. The English Romantic artist was chosen
       from a list of public nominations - the first time the Bank has
       asked who should appear on a specific banknote. The note, to be
       made of polymer, will eventually replace the current £20 note
       featuring the economist Adam Smith.

     * 5/31 Mitsubishi office raided in Japan as shares slide towards
       record low on fuel economy test scandal - Thursday April 21
       The offices of Mitsubishi have been raided in Japan after the
       company admitted to falsifying fuel economy data, sending shares
       plummeting 35 per cent in two days. Investors watched in horror as
       the stock price fell a further 20 per cent on Thursday to trade
       around 583 yen following a raid on the Mitsubishi plant in the
       central Japanese city of Okazaki. Trading was halted due to the
       surfeit of investors trying to sell stock. More than third of the
       company's value evaporated in the sell-off.

       The oil price is in retreat this morning after Kuwaiti workers
       ended a three day strike. Brent crude has slumped by 2.5 per cent
       already, down over $1 to $42.95 per barrel, as traders anticipate
       more oil flowing from Kuwait again. Workers had walked out on
       Sunday, protesting against austerity cutbacks that will hit their
       wages and benefits. It’s not clear what concessions they have been
       handed.The strike by oil workers has slashed Kuwait's output, but

     * 7/31 Netflix shares nose-dive on growth and pricing fears - Tuesday
       April 19
       Netflix shares plunged nearly 11 per cent in after-hours trading on
       Wall Street over fears the video streaming company’s growth is
       stalling as it faces an attack on its market share from Amazon.
       Numbers were lower than analysts, who had anticipated 580,000 in
       the US and 3.5 million globally, were looking for. It has 81.5
       million users worldwide.The video streaming group, home to House of
       Cards and Marco Polo, posted a first-quarter profit of $28 million
       (£19.6 million), up $4 million on last year.One reasons for the
       slowing growth is that the company has been pushing up its charges.
       It is also facing tough competition from Hulu and Amazon, which
       unveiled a new monthly subscription pricing model yesterday.
     * 8/31 The Treasury Brexit equation - Monday April 18
       These are the equations at the heart of the Treasury’s economic
       model, which is designed to quantify the impact of Britain leaving
       the European Union. It’s this model that produced the result cited
       by Chancellor George Osborne today that the economy could be 6 per
       cent smaller in 2030 (relative to staying in the EU) and each
       household £4,300 worse off.
     * 9/31 Chinese growth slides - Friday April 15
       China’s economy grew at its slowest pace since 2009 in the first
       three months of the year, although there were signs that the
       world’s second-largest economy was stabilising. The so-called
       Dragon economy grew 6.7 per cent in the first quarter, official
       figures showed. That was down slightly on the previous quarter’s
       6.8 per cent but in line with Beijing’s forecasts. Chinese banks
       issued nearly double the amount of new loans in March than in
       February while retail sales growth accelerated from 10.2 per cent
       to 10.5 per cent and industrial output advanced from 5.4 per cent
       to 6.8 per cent, well ahead of expectations.

     * 12/31 IMF warns Brexit will create 'severe global damage' - Tuesday
       April 12
       The IMF has slashed the UK’s growth forecasts for this year, saying
       uncertainty created by the Brexit referendum in June is already
       hurting the domestic economy. It is a major intervention from the
       IMF into the referendum debate. The IMF’s managing director
       Christine Lagarde has previously spoken about the negative economic
       impact of Brexit. But this is the first major warning from the Fund
       itself. The IMF cut its 2016 GDP growth forecast for Britain to 1.9
       per cent, down from the 2.2 per cent it projected in January. After
       Japan, it was the joint second largest downgrade handed out to any
       country in the G7.

       Brighton Pier, one of UK’s most iconic structures, is set to be
       sold in an £18 million deal to Eclectic Bar Group, chaired by

       landmark in East Sussex was placed on the market for the first time
       in more than 25 years back in 2011, before being withdrawn the
       following year. The group said the purchase of the “iconic British

       Marks & Spencer’s new boss today vowed to leave no stone unturned
       in his quest to overturn the High Street stalwart’s
       “unsatisfactory” performance in clothing after yet another slump in
       womenswear sales. Steve Rowe, who took over as chief executive this
       week, said improving the retailer’s clothing and homeware was at
       the top of his to-do list after it revealed a 2.7% decline in
       same-store sales in its fourth quarter.

       US drugs giant Pfizer has scrapped a planned merger with Ireland's

       days after the US Treasury announced fresh plans to prevent deals
       known as "inversions", where a US firm merges with a company in a
       country with a lower tax rate. The Pfizer-Allergan deal, valued at
       $160bn (£113bn), would have been the biggest example of an
       "inversion".

       came a day after a leak of four decades of documents from a
       Panamanian law firm that specialises in setting up offshore
       companies showed widespread use of those instruments by global

       tax is to be cut even further than previously announced.The

       all companies would fall to 17 per cent from the 28 per cent at
       which it stood at when the Conservatives came to power. The
       Chancellor also unveiled a sugar tax. The levy, which will raise

       10.9 per cent to £305.5 m. That was party a result of higher
       pension charges, but operating profits also fell as fewer shoppers
       headed to the high street.

       themselves following drugs test - Tuesday March 8
       Sponsors have moved quickly to distance themselves from Maria
       Sharapova after the five-time Grand Slam tennis champion admitted
       failing a drug test. In addition to the moves from Nike and Swiss
       watchmaker Tag Heuer, German carmaker Porsche said it was
       “postponing planned activities” with Ms Sharapova until the
       situation became clearer. Ms Sharapova said she had been taking
       meldonium since 2006, on the advice of her family doctor.

     * 31/31 'Spotlight' distributor slumps - Thursday March 3
       Film revenues at Entertainment One slumped by 14 per cent in the
       final nine months of 2015. But E1, which has international
       distribution rights for the Oscar-winner 'Spotlight' (picture),
       said a 39 per cent rise in its TV business had left overall sales 3
       per cent lower.

   That the biotechnology and corporate farming world is a place with some
   dark corners is not really open to debate. But deliberately poisoning
   people as an act of revenge? There is scant evidence for the theory,
   apart from the fact that the strand of E.coli that made its customers
   sick is not your usual, run-of-the-mill E.coli. Who knew? That won’t
   stop the theory gaining even more momentum, and Chipotle has little
   incentive to quash the rumours – so it hasn’t. If people are willing to
   believe it is the victim and not the perpetrator, well why not let them
   think that?

   Regardless of where the E.coli came from, and the investigation will
   surely bring that to light, eating at Chipotle is a really bad idea.
   Whether the meat and veg is GM or carrying bacteria, eating a Chipotle
   burrito is far worse than eating a Big Mac. Add in a few trimmings like
   chips, guacamole and cheese, and your Tex-Mex mouthful is rapidly
   approaching 2,000 calories, not including a drink. That’s twice as many
   as are in a Big Mac meal with a Coke.

   Forget conspiracies, the truth is already out there: nobody is doing a
   better job of poisoning Chipotle’s customers than Chipotle’s customers
   themselves.

   The drug prices rocket and the bosses are shameless

   After a short delay caused by the inconvenience of his arrest and
   subsequent bail conditions, Martin Shkreli finally appeared in front of
   Congress on Thursday. The “Pharma Bro”, a poor man’s Bond villain minus
   the charm, was supposed to be grilled about pricing at his company
   Turing Pharmaceuticals, famous only for having spiked the price of a
   drug used primarily by HIV patients by 5,000 per cent last summer.

   As expected, without a promise that his testimony would not be used in
   any federal prosecutions, Mr Shkreli pleaded the 5th Amendment and
   declined to answer questions. His arrest in December was related to
   allegations he defrauded investors in a previous job at a hedge fund,
   but the move was perhaps quite wise. Although extorting money out of
   patients fighting for their lives is an American tradition, not a
   criminal offence.

   That the perfectly repulsive Mr Shkreli smirked his way through
   proceedings and then used his Twitter account to call members of
   Congress “imbeciles” was not shocking either. Before that tweet, his
   hapless attorney Benjamin Brafman had the gall to claim that his client
   “meant no disrespect”, a piece of logic-defying mental gymnastics that
   ought to win him a prize of some sort. Mr Shkreli’s day in Congress was
   a complete waste of taxpayer money that confirmed nothing we don’t
   already know about Pharma Bro.

   All of which was a distraction from discussing anything meaningful. The
   congressional hearing should have performed an important function,
   publicly holding pharmaceutical executives to account for rocketing
   drug prices and unethical business practices. It even had bipartisan
   support. But inviting the Internet’s Most Hated Man™ along was never
   going to achieve anything other than create tabloid fodder.

   The important testimony, from Valeant Pharmaceuticals’ interim chief
   executive Howard Schiller, was lost in the noise. His answers when
   questioned about Valeant’s decision to raise the prices of two
   important heart drugs (only two of several that Valeant has bought and
   immediately marked up) were even more absurd than Mr Shkreli’s tweet,
   which in fairness wasn’t completely untrue.

   Mr Schiller said: “Because these drugs are hospital-administered and
   are not purchased by patients directly, increasing the cost of the
   drugs would affect the hospitals’ profits.” Poppycock. What happens is
   that hospitals pass the cost of drugs on to insurance companies, which
   then pass the cost on to customers. It’s an explanation that only the
   hopelessly naive or ignorant would accept.

   And so Congress achieved nothing except to further Mr Shkreli’s infamy.
   Unless he ends up spending a few years in solitary on Rikers Island,
   there is almost no chance of a serious, open discussion on drug costs.

   Which is probably exactly how the pharmaceutical industry wants it.
