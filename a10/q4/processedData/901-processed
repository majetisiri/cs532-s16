   When PETA U.S., a Tesla Motors shareholder, spoke at Tesla’s 2015
   annual meeting to urge the company to offer only vegan leather for its
   car interiors, CEO Elon Musk said that he would “absolutely” consider
   it. PETA U.S. has been working with Tesla since then, and this year,
   the electric-car leader launched the [4]Model X—its highly anticipated
   SUV—which is available with a fully vegan interior, including seats,
   steering wheel, and gear shift.

   In its discussions with the company, PETA U.S. pointed out that Tesla
   could reduce its carbon footprint by using only vegan leather, because
   leather production produces massive amounts of the carbon emissions
   that contribute to climate change. It also squanders valuable natural
   resources, including up to 15,000 gallons of water per ton of hides.
   Turning animal skins into leather requires 130 different chemicals,
   including cyanide, and people who work in and live near tanneries
   suffer from various ailments that result from exposure to these toxic
   chemicals. And, of course, cows endure branding, tail-docking,
   dehorning, and castration—all without painkillers—before ultimately
   being killed by having their throats slit, often while still conscious.

   Tesla has showrooms in China, Hong Kong, and Japan.
