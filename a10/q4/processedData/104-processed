       I love Chipotle and I really don't mind this location.  The
       employees are friendly and the customer service is excellent.  Last
       time I came, I ordered a chicken & steak bowl.  They are very
       generous with their portions and give you more than you expect.  I
       asked for white rice and brown rice and they hooked it up.  When I
       told the lady black and pinto beans, she gave me what I asked no
       questions asked.  I completely understand when they try to minimize
       on giving you meat, but other than that they are generous with
       everything else.  My bowl was only full by the time it reached the
       end of the line.  I was very satisfied!
       I come here often on my lunch break, I was able to quickly take my
       food was able to get back to work.  My work is only 5 minutes from
       this Chipotle so it only took me 15 minutes before I  got back to
       my desk to enjoy it.  The food was excellent!  The steak tasted
       awesome :)  So happy to have a Chipotle close by where I work!

       First time going here yesterday.  2 1/2 stars.
       Got myself a chicken burrito with brown rice, beans, etc.
       Chicken burrito is ok for a fast food type burrito.  Wasn't
       anything for me to be excited about. It's ok, I would get it again
       if I'm somewhere on a road trip and that's my choice between here
       and greasy burgers.
       Customer Service was ok, nothing to complain about.
       So many other great local mom and pop places I can go to in Long
       Beach, I'm just going to leave this place to the kids that don't
       know any better.

       This location always seems to be missing something but it's the
       closest to me so I have to make due.
       My trip today consisted of waiting almost 10 minutes while the
       chicken was being replenished, the absolute last of the black
       beans, scraps of remaining veggies, and zero green tobasco sauce
       available or seen anywhere on tables or on top of the trash cans.
       Two stars because at least the employees are nice, just not well
       run.

       Ok I like chipotle food- especially when I don't have too cook. I'm
       always observing customer service and the way the vibe and how
       co-workers treat each other. I am definitely in awe today- saw
       great attitude, helpfulness and above all respect for each other.
       I've always been in line and got the "ok what u want" stare at
       plenty of food venues, and all the other chipotles but not when I
       came here. I will definitely chose this Chipotle as my choice when
       I'm not cooking, especially when they treat you as a superstar
       customer.

       DON'T NOT EAT HERE. I uploaded a photo of the burrito I got and I
       couldn't believe that they can sell these for 10 dollars. My
       burrito wasn't even a burrito they just folded it over itself and
       there is holes in the tortilla. It's really sad that they can't
       even train their employees to make the main thing that they offer.

            Apparently this is considered a burrito. $10 for a glob of
            tortilla roughly the same size as my side of guacamole.

       When I hear someone mention Chipotle, Barbacoa always comes to
       mind. So, I knew that's what I'd be ordering as I stood in line
       waiting to place my order. It was a little busy as it was lunch
       hour and I guess a lot of people made their way to Chipotle, now
       that there's finally a location in the area of Atlantic and Spring,
       in Long Beach. I just happened to swing by with a coworker because
       we needed something fast because we had an afternoon meeting right
       after lunch.
       Line moved along pretty steadily. Serving portion was okay - seen
       more and seen less at other locations. My portion size was more
       than the person behind me so I'm not complaining. Staff was
       somewhat friendly - efficient as they kept the line moving. The
       staff clearing tables was pretty efficient - as I mentioned earlier
       - it was a little busy because of the lunch rush.
       My burrito was what I expected. My coworker felt the same about her
       chips & guac as well as her bowl.
       Chipotle won't be a regular lunch spot for me but now that there's
       one close to work, it's there should I decide I need to get my
       yearly fix.

       I love Chipotle but I really dislike this location.  The employees
       are unfriendly and the customer service is non-existent.  Last time
       I came, I ordered a chicken & steak bowl.  They are very stingy
       with their portions and give you the bare minimum of each
       ingredient.  I asked for white rice and they give me a small scoop.
        When I told the lady no beans, just more rice, she gave me less
       then half a scoop and passed my bowl on to the next person.  I
       completely understand when they try to minimize on giving you meat,
       but rice is so cheap!  My bowl was only halfway filled by the time
       it reached the end of the line... for the price I paid, I felt
       cheated.
       Since I was on my lunch break, I quickly took my food and left.  My
       work is only 3 minutes from this chipotle so it only sat 6-8
       minutes by the time I got back to my desk to eat it.  The food was
       completely cold!  Even the steak tasted like it just came from the
       fridge.  I called immediately and requested to speak with the
       manager.  All the manager could tell me was he didn't get any other
       complaints about it & to bring it back so they could make another
       bowl.  Rude! Unfortunately, I didn't have time to bring it back so
       had to eat as is.  Very disappointed!

       All I have to say is the customer service here was amazing for me
       and my family today! Any place that is attentive to me when I'm
       with my two very young kids (especially when one is melting down
       because you wake them mid-nap from the car) definitely deserves a
       five star review! Even though it's a pretty small space in there
       they helped bring the food to the table, grabbed a clean spoon for
       my youngest one after he accidentally dropped it on the floor, and
       even gave us a discount on our bill because they were out of flour
       tortillas for our kids meals. Thanks guys! This tired mama
       definitely appreciated the dinner time help :-)

       I haven't been to a Chipotle in awhile so I decided to come today.
       The two stars both go to the girl at the beginning of the assembly
       line. She seemed to be the only person working right now who knows
       anything about customer service. Everyone else was doing other
       things while serving and kept leaving the line so by the time I
       finally got my burrito it was cold. The girl at the cash register
       didn't look at me once. I'll go to Chipotle again but not this
       location which sucks because it's close to my work.

       Half of their items were out when I arrived. I waited for them to
       make more food. They were able to quickly get everything together
       and comped my meal for me after all the waiting. The lady at the
       front was very pleasant. The visit started out bad but they pulled
       it together and were able to make happy customer out of me!

       I visited Chipotle on September 21, 2015 at about 9:35pm. I had
       never been to this location before. I entered and there was no
       line. As I was placing my order I felt like the staff was rushing
       my through the line as if they were busy. There was no one behind
       me.
       I wanted to order a half steak and half barbacoa bowl, but before I
       could even say the other half of my order the staff member had
       already put half steak and half chicken. I didn't object because it
       wasn't a big deal to me. My boyfriend ordered a steak bowl, as
       well. The staff member handling the meat put such a small portions
       of meat and didn't even give me time to ask for onions and bell
       peppers before she passed my bowl to the next staff member. I had
       to ask the new member for more meat and onions and bell peppers.
       She looked at the bowls and added a bit more, and didn't tell me it
       was an extra charge for extra meat nor was I charged.
       When I was paying I realized we forgot to ask for a tortillas. The
       cashier told the first staff member in the assembly line and she
       made them for us. I was getting my drink as they were making them.
       The cashier then called me over and said it was ready. When she
       handed it to me it was so hot I had to throw it on the counter next
       to the fountain drinks. I would have appreciated a warning on how
       hot they were. When I got home the skin on my hand had bubbled from
       the burn and I touched the tortillas and they were still scorching
       hot.
       Call me old fashioned but I prefer my food without injury.

       I love Chipotle... I love the concept of assembly line Mexican
       food. For me, burrito bowl is the way to go, and I always get half
       and half of sofritas and chicken (or steak, if I am feeling beefy
       that day). I always ask for sour cream on the side, because
       Chipotle seems to love giving blobs of sour cream (I blame the
       spoon they use.) Too much sour cream is too much.
       I give this location a 3 star because of the store itself. Its very
       nice and clean! But damn the store itself is way too small. The
       line wraps around the perimeter of the store, which at times BLOCKS
       the entrance. There's a few tables inside, but there's even more
       seating outside. I'm guessing they made the store smaller to
       accommodate a larger patio (which has a great view of DT Long
       Beach)?

       I don't think that Yelp is the place to rate chain restaurants but
       the service at the Signal Hill Chiptole has always been friendly
       and fast.   Even during the busy lunch hours, I'm always greeted
       with a smile and the staff seem to enjoy their jobs.
       The portions are always reasonable and the taste is always the best
       as expected.  I'd go a little out of my way to hit this Chiptole
       than some closer ones.

       So I wanted to give this Chipotle location a chance. The last two
       times I came here was just awful. The restaurant was a mess,
       including the kitchen area, which is very visible to the customers.
       The chicken was room temperature, and the ran out of 143brown rice
       and fajitas.
       Today was great. Found was great and restaurant is clean. I would
       give it a 5, but the staff needs to greet their costumers and smile
       a little.

       I don't know why everyone is being a bunch of jerks about this
       place, but it is pretty much like every freakin Chipotle around.
       Yes, at lunch time a lot of people all show up at once and get in a
       line to order their food, and yes you have to wait patiently.  They
       are new so maybe the crew hasn't gotten into a rhythm yet, but I
       don't think it is any worse than any other one that I have been to.
       The place is clean, they have a nice outdoor patio area, and the
       staff is friendly and courteous.  Though pricey I enjoy being able
       to eat somewhere that promotes organic products, and lets you know
       which ingredients are GMO or not.  Also, they plan on phasing out
       all GMO products which is a tough task.
       This location is close to my work, and the couple of times I have
       been here I haven't had a problem.  I will continue to come to this
       location despite all the crappy reviews of apparently very
       impatient people.

       Please scrape your damn grill!!!  Every time I come to this
       location, the grill is black.  So every single time I have to pick
       out the overly burnt chicken in my bowl. EVERY SINGLE TIME.

       I'm not a huge Chipotle fan in the first place, but this was the
       most disgusting burrito I've ever had in my entire life!  My mom &
       I went to this place and got a burrito with the normal fix-ins.
       She ate less than half of it and quit eating it because it was so
       gross and she did not want it.  So I tried a bite of it and OMG.
       Ewwwwww.  It was disgusting.  It was a pile of MUSHY ingredients
       wrapped up in a tortilla.  Literally mush and looked like baby
       food!  If it had been any mushier, it would have been soup!  With
       the normal ingredients, she asked for light sour cream and
       guacamole and it was as if they put an entire container of sour
       cream and guacamole in there.  Totally gross...it resembled baby
       food!  Will not be returning to Chipotle Mexican Grill ever!

       My siblings and I were hungry so we decided to go eat. We couldn't
       decide whether to get In N' Out or Chipotle since it was in the
       same plaza. In the end, we ended up getting Chipotle. Which turns
       out to be a huge mistake.
       We came around 9pm and there was only two people in front of us.
       The two stars are for the fast service. Everything else was pretty
       bad. The staff didn't look as friendly. The guy that serve us just
       gave us a cold stare like he didn't want to be there. I guess I
       understand because I work at a restaurant also. It can be stressful
       & annoying but he didn't even bother to just try or at least say
       something, like a hi maybe?
       Plus the food was plain, didn't have much flavors to it. I was
       disappointed because I expected better after it has been opened for
       about 2+ months! C'mon now. I think I'll just drive further to the
       traffic circle or to the lakewood one instead next time. Sorry
       guys! I won't be trying it in a while so that it could be improved.
       Considering I don't eat Chipotle a lot.
       Well I hope people have better experience than I did today. Don't
       want to sound mean but woops. Won't be coming here anytime soon.
       It's a nice location too. So whenever you're indecisive... go for
       In N' Out! You can never go wrong with that.

       I loved Chipotle when I'd visit the one in the Traffic Circle. This
       one turned me off because the food was cold when I got home and
       cheese not even melted?
       They need to learn food storage as well for online orders as I ask
       for my sour cream on the side and they always put it in the bag and
       put it in the warmer. I always take it out and ask for a new, cold
       one.
