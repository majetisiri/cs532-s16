   Author: Chef Adriana Martin
   Recipe type: Main Dish
   Cuisine: Asian Cuisine
   Serves: 4 servings
   Ingredients
     * 1 box of Minute® Whole Grain Brown Rice
     * 3 cups of hot water
     * 1 teaspoon of grapeseed oil
     * ½ of red pepper cut in juliennes
     * ½ of a green pepper cut in juliennes
     * ½ of an orange pepper cut in juliennes
     * ½ of a white onion cut in juliennes
     * 5 white mushrooms cut in slices
     * 2 cups of fresh snow peas
     * 1 teaspoon of garlic powder
     * 1 teaspoon of garlic paste
     * 1 teaspoon of ginger paste
     * 1 teaspoon of dried chipotle pepper flakes
     * 1 tablespoon of Kikkoman Soy Sauce Low Sodium
     * 2 cups of raw shrimps cleaned and deveined
     * 2 cups of Dole Pineapple Chunks in 100% Pineapple Juice
     * ½ cup of Kikkoman Orange Sauce
     * 1 tablespoon of roasted sesame seeds
     * 1 tablespoon of cashews for garnishing (optional)

   Instructions
    1. In order to save time in the kitchen I am using precut veggies and
       ready to use shrimps, you can do the same. If not, then do the prep
       of the veggies and the shrimps before starting the cooking process.
    2. Cook the Minute® Whole Grain Brown Rice following the instructions
       in the package. It is ready in 10 minutes.
    3. In a large pan add grapeseed oil and fry the veggies, add the snow
       peas, and the seasonings following the order of the list.
    4. Add the shrimps and cook those for 5 minutes until pink. Add the
       Dole Pineapple Chunks in 100% Pineapple Juice and sweeten the dish
       with Kikkoman Orange Sauce. Finish with the sesame seeds and serve
       over a bed of brown rice.
    5. You can garnish with roasted cashews if desired.

   Notes
   You can use pork or chicken instead of shrimps

   Chinese New year is celebrated from February 7th to 13th and this is
   considered a very important holiday in China. 2016 Chinese New Year
   will be the year of the Monkey. If you were born on 1920, 1932, 1944,
   1956, 1968, 1980, 1992, 2004, or 2016 your Chinese Zodiac is “Monkey”.
   Those that have this sign are described as witty, intelligent and
   with magnetic personality.

   Chipotle Pineapple Shrimp Stir Fry Recipe

   In the Chinese Zodiac my husband is a Rooster and I am a Rabbit but I
   have to confess, I am not a believer in the zodiac signs and
   predictions. I am more into the philosophy of working hard, living
   well, respecting others, having positive thoughts and doing the right
   thing to have good luck in life.

   IFRAME: [83]https://www.youtube.com/embed/YTtJZiDcB2Y?rel=0&showinfo=0

   But this celebration of the Chinese New Year isn’t only about the signs
   and predictions. Chinese culture is very well known to be rich in
   traditions, just like my latino culture. The Chinese New Year was first
   set to coincide with the farming cycle because in the past most of the
   population in China were farmers and the new year was considered a
   winter holiday in preparation to receive the Spring and get ready to
   farm the land.

   Chinese New Year was a time to pray for a good harvest, rest, and spend
   time with the family. And now has evolved to celebrate the start of a
   new business year and wishing for profits and success in business, but
   still the family values and togetherness is an important component of
   the celebration. As well as enjoying a well deserved vacation to start
   the year energized.

   Taking traditions from other cultures enriches our lives as we see the
   world from a different point of view while we adopt certain
   celebrations and make those work with our own beliefs. That is why we
   celebrate Chinese New year at home. Same as the Chinese, in my latino
   culture family and hope for good fortune are very important, so during
   Chinese new year we pray for a good harvest on any project and dream we
   embark, while enjoying a tasty dish inspired in Asian favorites.

   Like this Chipotle Pineapple Shrimp Stir Fry, made with
   [87]Kikkoman Soy Sauce with less sodium. A soy sauce that is brewed
   with water, wheat, soybeans and salt. It has the same great flavor as
   the regular soy sauce but with 37% less sodium. It is always good to
   look for products that allow us to cook with less salt to reduce sodium
   intake.

   To add sweetness to the dish I have used Kikkoman Orange Sauce
   and [89]Dole Pineapple Chunks in 100% pineapple juice. Using canned
   pineapple it is a good idea because not only saves time but the
   freshness of the fruit is perfect for desserts and for savory
   applications, like this Chipotle Pineapple Shrimp Stir Fry. I am glad
   that Dole canned pineapple is rich in Vitamin C, has low sodium and is
   cholesterol free.

   Any good stir fry needs a perfect pairing, and I have

   has fiber because it is 100% whole grain and precooked, making the
   cooking process a breeze since you can have perfect brown rice in just
   10 minutes. This rice has a nutty flavor, no MSG, it is gluten free and
   has no preservatives.

   My husband and girls loves Chinese food. A recipe they’ll love that
   takes 20 minutes or so is a plus for me. Can’t wait to try this recipe.
