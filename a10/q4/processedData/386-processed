[32]Is Chipotle E coli Ordeal A Fast Food False Flag?

   « on: December 22, 2015, 10:15:49 PM »
   Oh, here I go again!  Claiming there's a FF behind every suspicious
   event!
   Well, Monsanto is a part of the military industrial complex.  ... and
   Chipotle is /was the flagship fast food restaurant thumbing their NON
   GMO nose at the military company Monsanto.  ...and it just so happens
   to be damn coincidental that Chipotle would be under an E coli attack
   as their NON GMO campaign was taking off like a rocket ship.  You don't
   hear much about that anymore.
   Chipotle was also under attack before the E coli (on going) 'event' for
   non organic issues.
   Anyway, I was wondering if the military (via Monsanto) has weaponized E
   Coli that can be dispersed through 'inside aerosolization'.  Or does
   monsanto call their buddies at the DHS, and order them up some 'crisis
   actors' signed under 'national security' to fake an illness that the
   'bought and paid' for CDC (ALSO a BIG friend of monsanto) to
   substantiate the false E coli claims with the goal of ruining the
   popular fast-food restaurant for going NON GMO.  Which, by the way, was
   well received by the public.
   Are the CEO's of certain other companies getting anonymous
   communication that the same will happen to them if they try to break
   from the GMO chains of the NWO?
   It's not that Chipotle in of itself is a big deal, but that a flagship
   multi million, if not billion dollar company was going off the NWO
   reservation. That being the bigger deal, because, let's face it, the
   GMO industry is hanging on by life support and a growing number of blue
   chip companies going NON GMO could really put a nail into the coffin
   GMO's forever.
   It will be interesting to see if Chipotle will continue it's dedication
   to NON GMO food or will it 'cease and diciest' by threat of the NWO?

   The media gets a whole lots of money from Monsanto / big NWO agro from
   every direction.
   It's going to be a wait and see if they buckle and submit or stay
   committed to fighting the good fight.

   [49]ANALYSIS: Chipotle Is a Victim of Corporate Sabotage... Biotech
   Industry Food Terrorists Are Planting e.coli in Retaliation for
   Restaurant's Anti-GMO Menu
   (NaturalNews) After observing recent events involving Chipotle and
   e.coli, here's my analysis of the situation: Chipotle's e.coli
   outbreaks are not random chance. They are the result of the biotech
   industry unleashing bioterrorism attacks against the only fast food
   company that has publicly denounced GMOs.
   How do we know? The CDC has already admitted that some of these e.coli
   outbreaks involve a "rare genetic strain" of e.coli not normally seen
   in foods. Furthermore, we also know the track record of the biotech
   industry engaging in the most criminal, dirty, sleazebag tactics
   imaginable against any person or company that speaks out against GMOs.
   Doctor Oz, for example, was maliciously targeted in a defamation
   campaign funded by the biotech industry earlier this year. The
   onslaught against Oz was initiated because he publicly expressed his
   support for honest GMO labeling on foods.
   As the attacks escalated, Doctor Oz had his own team investigate the
   source of the attacks and found they were all biotech industry shills,
   some with felony criminal records and long histories of dubious
   propaganda activities targeting anti-GMO activists.
   GMO industry routinely resorts to tactics that resemble terrorism or
   criminal mafias
   As a clean food advocate myself, I know firsthand of the malicious
   tactics used by these biotech mafia operations, including tactics of
   intimidation and terrorism, such as calling in bomb threats to
   locations where clean food activists are about to speak.
   There is absolutely no question that the biotech industry will resort
   to ANY activity necessary to destroy food companies that oppose GMOs.
   And yes, this includes acts of bioterrorism against Chipotle --
   something that's ridiculously easy for biotech industry operatives to
   carry out with simple, low-cost laboratory supplies sold online at
   places like Amazon.com.
   In my HealthRangerReport.com podcast, shown below, I am now openly
   encouraging Chipotle's management to initiate a criminal investigation
   with the FBI to attempt to identify the sources of this corporate
   sabotage campaign.
   To be clear, what's really happening at Chipotle is that biotech
   industry shills are deliberately contaminating Chipotle's food with
   strains of e.coli in a malicious attempt to destroy both the reputation
   and finances of the Chipotle food chain. This act of bioterrorism is
   entirely consistent with the known behavior patterns of the biotech
   industry which, for example, engaged in illegal money laundering in
   Washington state in order to destroy the GMO labeling bill there.
   The biotech industry not only sells deadly glyphosate herbicide poison
   that destroys human health (and contaminates ecosystems), it also uses
   its dirty money to financially influence academics, journalists and
   lawmakers. Those individuals who don't fall into line with the biotech
   agenda are then treated to intense campaigns of defamation, slander,
   intimidation and threats to try to silence or discredit them.
   And when that doesn't work, biotech industry operatives will literally
   engage in acts of terrorism like we're seeing right now with Chipotle.
   To understand the biotech industry, you have to first understand that
   these are truly EVIL people who have no ethical boundaries whatsoever.
   They will target and destroy any person, any institution or any public
   company that they see as standing in their way of total world
   domination over the seed supply (and hence the food supply). The idea
   that exposing the public to e.coli might be harmful to some people
   doesn't cause them to hesitate for even a moment. The more people get
   sick or die from their Chipotle operation, the better for biotech!

   I am pretty convinced that Chipotle's has been sabotaged.  This is what
   happens when you boast that your restaurant uses Non-GMO Organic
   products and tries to buy from local Organic Farmers for the produce
   and meats.
   I still eat there!  What...is McDonald's better or safer? I don't think
   so.

   WOW, Chipotle boasted they're non-gmo and organic?  YUP, false flag
   right there then, no doubt.  Reminds me of a super-organic farmer where
   the sheeple public freaked out due to NWO brainwashing and wanted him
   to be charged with BIOTERRORISM for refusing to vaccinate his animals
   on his farm (forget if it was in North or South Carolina).
   Who the f_ck cares about E-coli anyway--just slam a half cup of
   homemade nanosilver, among other natural anti-pathogenic substances
   available.  I want to start seeing the actual perpetrators of these
   false flags start to get caught on video or in the act, and stopped and
   shot on the spot for attempted murder.  Imagine if the news reported on
   TV "Red Team working for the CIA caught trying to poison non-gmo food
   were shot dead by armed Americans defending their country against
   psychopathic fascist eugenicists."

   Weaponized E. Coli outbreak in Europe exposed as a state sponsored

     Forensic evidence emerges that European e.coli superbug was
     bioengineered to produce human fatalities

     Even as the veggie blame game is now under way across the EU, where
     a super resistant strain of e.coli is sickening patients and filling
     hospitals in Germany, virtually no one is talking about how e.coli
     could have magically become resistant to eight different classes of
     antibiotic drugs and then suddenly appeared in the food supply.
     This particular e.coli variation is a member of the O104 strain, and
     O104 strains are almost never (normally) resistant to antibiotics.
     In order for them to acquire this resistance, they must be
     repeatedly exposed to antibiotics in order to provide the mutation
     pressure that nudges them toward complete drug immunity.
     So if youre curious about the origins of such a strain, you can
     essentially reverse engineer the genetic code of the e.coli and
     determine fairly accurately which antibiotics it was exposed to
     during its development. This step has now been done (see below), and
     when you look at the genetic decoding of this O104 strain now
     threatening food consumers across the EU, a fascinating picture
     emerges of how it must have come into existence.
     The genetic code reveals the history
     When scientists at Germanys Robert Koch Institute decoded the
     genetic makeup of the O104 strain, they found it to be resistant to
     all the following classes and combinations of antibiotics:
     penicillins
     tetracycline
     nalidixic acid
     trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol
     cephalosporins
     amoxicillin / clavulanic acid
     piperacillin-sulbactam
     piperacillin-tazobactam
     In addition, this O104 strain posses an ability to produce special
     enzymes that give it what might be called bacteria superpowers known
     technically as ESBLs:
     Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBLs) are enzymes that can be
     produced by bacteria making them resistant to cephalosporins e.g.
     cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime which are the most widely
     used antibiotics in many hospitals, explains the Health Protection
     Agency in the UK ([62]http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/Infect).
     On top of that, this O104 strain possesses two genes TEM-1 and
     CTX-M-15 that have been making doctors shudder since the 1990s,
     reportsThe Guardian ([63]http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentis). And
     why do they make doctors shudder? Because theyre so deadly that many
     people infected with such bacteria experience critical organ failure
     and simply die.
     Bioengineering a deadly superbug
     So how, exactly, does a bacterial strain come into existence thats
     resistant to over a dozen antibiotics in eight different drug
     classes and features two deadly gene mutations plus ESBL enzyme
     capabilities?
     Theres really only one way this happens (and only one way) you have
     to expose this strain of e.coli to all eight classes of antibiotics
     drugs. Usually this isnt done at the same time, of course: You first
     expose it to penicillin and find the surviving colonies which are
     resistant to penicillin. You then take those surviving colonies and
     expose them to tetracycline. The surviving colonies are now
     resistant to both penicillin and tetracycline. You then expose them
     to a sulfa drug and collect the surviving colonies from that, and so
     on. It is a process of genetic selection done in a laboratory with a
     desired outcome. This is essentially how some bioweapons are
     engineered by the U.S. Army in its laboratory facility in Ft.
     Detrick, Maryland ([64]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation).
     Although the actual process is more complicated than this, the
     upshot is that creating a strain of e.coli thats resistant to eight
     classes of antibiotics requires repeated, sustained expose to those
     antibiotics. It is virtually impossible to imagine how this could
     happen all by itself in the natural world. For example, if this
     bacteria originated in the food (as weve been told), then where did
     it acquire all this antibiotic resistance given the fact that
     antibiotics are not used in vegetables?
     When considering the genetic evidence that now confronts us, it is
     difficult to imagine how this could happen in the wild. While
     resistance to a single antibiotic is common, the creation of a
     strain of e.coli thats resistant to eight different classes of
     antibiotics in combination simply defies the laws of genetic
     permutation and combination in the wild. Simply put, this superbug
     e.coli strain could not have been created in the wild. And that
     leaves only one explanation for where it really came from: the lab.
     Engineered and then released into the wild
     The evidence now points to this deadly strain of e.coli being
     engineered and then either being released into the food supply or
     somehow escaping from a lab and entering the food supply
     inadvertently. If you disagree with that conclusion and youre
     certainly welcome to then you are forced to conclude that this
     octobiotic superbug (immune to eight classes of antibiotics)
     developed randomly on its own and that conclusion is far scarier
     than the bioengineered explanation because it means octobiotic
     superbugs can simply appear anywhere at any time without cause. That
     would be quite an exotic theory indeed.
     My conclusion actually makes more sense: This strain of e.coli was
     almost certainly engineered and then released into the food supply
     for a specific purpose. What would that purpose be? Its obvious, I
     hope.
     Its all problem, reaction, solution at work here. First cause a
     PROBLEM (a deadly strain of e.coli in the food supply). Then wait
     for the public REACTION (huge outcry as the population is terrorized
     by e.coli). In response to that, enact your desired SOLUTION (total
     control over the global food supply and the outlawing of raw
     sprouts, raw milk and raw vegetables).
     Thats what this is all about, of course. The FDA relied on the same
     phenomenon in the USA when pushing for its recent Food Safety
     Modernization Act which essentially outlaws small family organic
     farms unless they lick the boots of FDA regulators. The FDA was able
     to crush farm freedom in America by piggybacking on the widespread
     fear that followed e.coli outbreaks in the U.S. food supply. When
     people are afraid, remember, its not difficult to get them to agree
     to almost any level of regulatory tyranny. And making people afraid
     of their food is a simple matter a few government press releases
     emailed to the mainstream media news affiliates is all it takes.
     First ban the natural medicine, then attack the food supply
     Now, remember: All this is happening on the heels of the EU ban on
     medicinal herbs and nutritional supplements a ban that blatantly
     outlaws nutritional therapies that help keep people healthy and free
     from disease. Now that all these herbs and supplements are outlawed,
     the next step is to make people afraid of fresh food, too. Thats
     because fresh vegetables are medicinal, and as long as the public
     has the right to buy fresh vegetables, they can always prevent
     disease.
     But if you can make people AFRAID of fresh vegetables or even outlaw
     them altogether then you can force the entire population onto a diet
     of dead foods and processed foods that promote degenerative disease
     and bolster the profits of the powerful drug companies.
     Its all part of the same agenda, you see: Keep people sick, deny
     them access to healing herbs and supplements, then profit from their
     suffering at the hands of the global drug cartels.
     GMOs play a similar role in all this, of course: Theyre designed to
     contaminate the food supply with genetic code that causes widespread
     infertility among human beings. And those who are somehow able to
     reproduce after exposure to GMOs still suffer from degenerative
     disease that enriches the drug companies from treatment.
     Do you recall which country was targeted in this recent e.coli
     scare? Spain. Why Spain? You may recall that leaked cables from
     Wikileaks revealed that Spain resisted the introduction of GMOs into
     its agricultural system, even as the U.S. government covertly
     threatened political retaliation for its resistance. This false
     blaming of Spain for the e.coli deaths is probably retaliation for
     Spains unwillingness to jump on the GMO bandwagon.
     Thats the real story behind the economic devastation of Spains
     vegetable farmers. Its one of the subplots being pursued alongside
     this e.coli superbug scheme.
     Food as weapons of war created by Big Pharma?
     By the way, the most likely explanation of where this strain of
     e.coli was bioengineered is that the drug giants came up with it in
     their own labs. Who else has access to all the antibiotics and
     equipment needed to manage the targeted mutations of potentially
     thousands of e.coli colonies? The drug companies are uniquely
     positioned to both carry out this plot and profit from it. In other
     words, they have the means and the motive to engage in precisely
     such actions.
     Aside from the drug companies, perhaps only the infectious disease
     regulators themselves have this kind of laboratory capacity. The
     CDC, for example, could probably pull this off if they really wanted
     to.
     The proof that somebody bioengineered this e.coli strain is written
     right in the DNA of the bacteria. Thats forensic evidence, and what
     it reveals cannot be denied. This strain underwent repeated and
     prolonged exposure to eight different classes of antibiotics, and
     then it somehow managed to appear in the food supply. How do you get
     to that if not through a well-planned scheme carried out by rogue
     scientists? There is no such thing as spontaneous mutation into a
     strain that is resistant to the top eight classes of brand-name
     antibiotic drugs being sold by Big Pharma today. Such mutations have
     to be deliberate.
     Once again, if you disagree with this assessment, then what youre
     saying is that NO, it wasnt done deliberately it happened
     accidentally! And again, Im saying thats even scarier! Because that
     means the antibiotic contamination of our world is now at such an
     extreme level of overkill that a strain of e.coli in the wild can be
     saturated with eight different classes of antibiotics to the point
     where it naturally develops into its own deadly superbug. If thats
     what people believe, then thats almost a scarier theory than the
     bioengineering explanation!
     A new era has begun: Bioweapons in your food
     But in either case no matter what you believe the simple truth is
     that the world is now facing a new era of global superbug strains of
     bacteria that cant be treated with any known pharmaceutical. They
     can all, of course, be readily killed with colloidal silver, which
     is exactly why the FDA and world health regulators have viciously
     attacked colloidal silver companies all these years: They cant have
     the public getting its hands on natural antibiotics that really
     work, you see. That would defeat the whole purpose of making
     everybody sick in the first place.
     In fact, these strains of e.coli superbugs can be quite readily
     treated with a combination of natural full-spectrum antibiotics from
     plants such as garlic, ginger, onions and medicinal herbs. On top of
     that, probiotics can help balance the flora of the digestive tract
     and crowd out the deadly e.coli that might happen by. A healthy
     immune system and well-functioning digestive tract can fight off an
     e.coli superbug infection, but thats yet another fact the medical
     community doesnt want you to know. They much prefer you to remain a
     helpless victim lying in the hospital, waiting to die, with no
     options available to you. Thats modern medicine for ya. They cause
     the problems that they claim to treat, and then they wont even treat
     you with anything that works in the first place.
     Nearly all the deaths now attributable to this e.coli outbreak are
     easily and readily avoidable. These are deaths of ignorance. But
     even more, they may also be deaths from a new era of food-based
     bioweapons unleashed by either a group of mad scientists or an
     agenda-driven institution that has declared war on the human
     population.

   Also, there is the war against meat ("man made" climate change related
   bullshit) so they've been false flagging meat, also causes austerity by
   making prices completely ridiculously unaffordable to most, by design.

     Agro-Terrorism and Food Safety
     Summer Meeting: July 18, 2007
     "Agriculture ranks among the most crucial of our nation's
     industries; yet, its reliability and productivity are often taken
     for granted." -- President George W. Bush
     We always worry about guns and bombs when it comes to terrorism, but
     have you ever considered being attacked by bacteria or acetone in
     your food?  As terrorists become more sophisticated, their abilities
     to harm us are advancing.  Today, Agro-terrorism is a real threat
     that the FBI is working hard to prevent.  And when you consider that
     last year almost 39 million tourists ate meals in Las Vegas, the
     concern here becomes apparent.  The FBIs Weapons of Mass Destruction
     Countermeasures Unit from Washington, DC, will be at the next
     InfraGard meeting to discuss this Agro-terrorism threat to Las
     Vegas.
     Are terrorists our only concerns with the safety of our food?  Can
     we still get sick or die from an accidental contamination?
     Unfortunately, yes.  Ground beef, onions, and Veggie Booty snacks
     are just a few of the food products recalled by manufacturers in the
     last several weeks due to concerns about contamination.  The
     accidental contamination of our food chain is just as important a
     threat as an intentional one.  The U.S. Department of Agricultures
     Food Safety and Inspection Service will explain at the next meeting
     the contamination threats to our food supply that it faces everyday.
     The InfraGard Southern Nevada Members Alliance will hold its summer
     meeting on Wednesday, July 18, 2007, at the Conference Room of the
     Clark County Library, 1401 East Flamingo Road, Las Vegas, Nevada.
     Lunch is partnered by USDN Network Security ([68]www.usdn.net) and
     will be served at 11:15 a.m.  The meeting will begin at 11:30 a.m.
     and should end at 1:30 p.m.
     This meeting is an open meeting and all individuals interested in
     InfraGard are eligible to attend.  Questions can be directed to FBI
     Special Agent David Schrom at (702) 657-5411 or

     What is Agro-Terrorism?
     The FBI defines Agro-terrorism as the deliberate introduction, use,
     or threatened use, of a chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear,
     or explosive agent against one or more components of the food or
     agriculture sectors, with the goal of causing mortality and
     morbidity, generating fear, inducing economic losses, or undermining
     sector stability and confidence in government.
     The FBI and InfraGard have created a Food-Agriculture InfraGard
     Special Interest Group (SIG) because of the significance of this
     threat.
     The Food-Agriculture Special Interest Group (SIG) is a resource
     dedicated to the safeguarding of the food and agriculture sectors of
     both private industry and government through information-sharing
     networks and a private secure portal of communication.  It is a
     collaborative effort of the FBI's Weapons of Mass Destruction
     Directorate and Cyber Divisions.
     The Food-Agriculture InfraGard SIG is intended to enhance the
     sharing of information among private-sector stakeholders who can be
     called on to assist the FBI in detecting, deterring, assessing, and
     preventing threats and attacks targeting the food and agriculture
     sectors of our nation's critical infrastructures.  It aims to be a
     consortium of agriculture security professionals and law enforcement
     officials with the common goal of protecting America's farmland,
     food products, animals, and industry.
     InfraGard members who wish access to this SIG can contact FBI
     Special Agent David Schrom, InfraGard Coordinator, at (702) 657-5411
     or [71]david.schrom@ic.fbi.gov This e-mail address is being

     FBI OUTREACH PROGRAMS
     The FBI has been involved in a variety of outreach efforts to assist
     in the preparedness efforts to harden US food or agriculture
     sectors.  The FBI has partnered with the US Department of
     Agriculture, Food and Drug Administration, and Department of
     Homeland Security to conduct site surveys of specific private
     industries within the food and agricultural industries.  This
     initiative is known as the Strategic Partnership Program
     Agro-Terrorism Initiative.  The purpose of this partnership is to
     identify the vulnerabilities, identify indicators and warnings that
     could signify planning for a terrorist attack, and develop
     mitigation strategies to reduce the threat, prevent an attack, and
     assist in the recovery should there be an attack.

     Meat Supplier Expands Ground Beef Recall
     (FOXNews.com) Meat supplier expands beef recall to 5.7 million
     pounds in 11 states over E. coli concerns.
     LOS ANGELES   A meat supplier has greatly expanded a ground beef
     recall, which now includes about 5.7 million pounds of fresh and
     frozen meat that may be contaminated with E. coli.
     David Goldman, acting administrator of the USDA Food Safety and
     Inspection Service, announced on Saturday that the recall would be
     expanded to include products with sell-by dates from April 6-April
     20. The beef, sold in 11 Western states, was distributed by
     California-based United Food Group LLC.
     Goldman said that none of the latest batch of suspect beef is in
     stores now because the product would be well past its expiration
     date, but consumers may still have some of the meat at home.
     "It is important for consumers to look in their freezers," Goldman
     said.
     The meat has been blamed for an E. coli outbreak in the Western
     states that resulted in 14 illnesses, spanning April 25 through May
     18. All the patients have recovered.
     On Wednesday, United Food Group expanded an initial recall of 75,000
     pounds of ground beef, adding another 370,000 pounds based on
     "unspecified concerns" raised by the California State Department of
     Health Services. This meat had sell-by dates from April 29-May 6

     I am pretty convinced that Chipotle's has been sabotaged.  This is
     what happens when you boast that your restaurant uses Non-GMO
     Organic products and tries to buy from local Organic Farmers for the
     produce and meats.
     I still eat there!  What...is McDonald's better or safer? I don't
     think so.

   Thread title you posted in years ago: E. coli Outbreak caused by
   militarized strain to stop Germany from opposing GMO

     This is just like saying that the U.S. Constitution and Bill of
     Rights were the reasons the 9/11 attacks happened.
     You will NEVER see an article that says:
     "Monsanto GMO farm behind E.Coli outbreak."

   [78]Quote from: iks83 on June 07, 2011, 02:56:24 AM

     Yep they will ruin every food producer that isnt part of their
     system. They said Spain producers are losing like 200 million euro
     per week because of this scare that turned out to be nothing. Oh
     they screamed ecoli found in organic sprouts on the front page. The
     backtrack you will find on page 57.
     Its from cucumbers! Cucumber producers ruined. Its from salad! Salad
     producers ruined. Its from sprouts! Sprout producers ruined. Every
     day a new food to blame. No word about genetic engineering, no word
     about bioweapon labs.

   [82]Chipotle now subject of broader criminal investigation; comp sales
   fall 14 pct
   Note in MSNBC corporate media article they (the corporate media) obsess
   about Chipotle's 'EARNINGS' & very little attention or coverage is
   given to the E coli subject matter.  Other than the fact the CDC can't
   or will not id the source of the E coli which lends one to think that
   between the earnings obsession and lack of evidence concerning E coli,
   that this entire 'operation' from the media to the CDC is corporate
   espionage.

   I think we need to support companies like this that are being

   Forensic evidence emerges that European e.coli superbug was
   bioengineered to produce human fatalities  [Great Post Effie Trinket]
   THE BLACK MAILING OF CHIPOTLE UNDERWAY
   Business Insider Tries To Pitch Idea That Chipotle Intended To Poison
   Their Patrons To Gross Negligence Minimum.
   [101]http://www.businessinsider.com/chipotle-federal-criminal-investiga
   tion-subpoena-2016-2
   This is the most despicable piece of so-called journalism.  They really
   must think the public is as dumb as a Mark Dice petition signee.
   One example of this, is that Business Insider quotes the governments
   outrage that Chipotle doesn't keep their food at 130F.  While cooked
   meat and veggies need to be held at that temperature, 90% of Chipotle's
   ingredients are raw veggies.   I find it very hard to believe it was a
   company policy NOT to maintain those temps even if one restaurant
   failed to do so.
   One other issue Business Insider misleads their readers, is that BI
   NEVER explains to the reader that the 'conspiracy theory' of the very
   REAL world of corporate espionage, does NOT have anything to do with
   Chipotle's "competitors", but has everything to do with the very
   corrupt biotech industry with Monsanto at the center.    No doubt BI is
   fully aware of this 'fact', and is doing their part to put the screws
   to a business with a NON GMO policy.
