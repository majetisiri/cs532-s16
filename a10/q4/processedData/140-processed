   Here's How Many People Stopped Eating at Chipotle During Their E. Coli
   Outbreak

   Although the cause still remains a mystery, Chipotle’s E. coli outbreak
   has been declared officially over by the CDC. But just what does an
   unexplained, months-long food poisoning outbreak do to the line of
   customers waiting at your counter?

   The [44]company’s new numbers are out, and from the beginning of last
   October to the end of the year, Chipotle’s total net income dropped 44
   percent and its sales fell 15 percent. If these numbers don’t seem
   particularly strong to you, compare it with the same timeframe last
   year, when the company’s revenue rose almost 10 percent and sales and
   net income were both on a small but steady uptick.

   But sales and percentages don’t really paint the picture. You know what
   does? Millions and millions of uneaten burritos. The difference in
   overall net income between the two periods came to $53,300,000 in lost
   sales. While it’s unclear just how many individual customers left
   during that time, we calculated out that cost in terms of some
   different Chipotle orders. The loss is equal to:

     * 5,640,211 barbacoa burritos with guacamole
     * 4,315,789 chicken salad bowls, with a side of guacamole and
       chips—plus an apple juice
     * 12,541,176 children’s quesadilla meals with chips and milk on the
       side
     * 5,004,694 crispy corn steak tacos (with extra steak)

   So, now that the outbreak is over, what’s next? It’s unclear. Memories
   of food-poisoning can be extremely short—and quickly replaced when a
   new outbreak pops into the news. But with the cause of this one still
   unknown, Chipotle’s E.coli nightmare could be harder to shake from
   memory than most.
