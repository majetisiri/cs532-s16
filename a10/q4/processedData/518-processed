Chipotle is making 5 major changes to its food

       filling orders on April 27, when the company announced it would use
       only non-GMO ingredients in its food.
       Chipotle customers might soon notice some slight changes to the
       taste of their burritos.
       The company said Tuesday that it had made numerous tweaks to its
       food preparation after two E. coli outbreaks that sickened more
       than 50 people in 14 states.
       Here's what has changed:
       1. Chipotle is now marinating chopped onions, jalapenos, and
       cilantro in citrus juice when it makes salsas and guacamole.
       "This process brings out more flavor from these ingredients and
       adds another measure of food safety," Chipotle co-CEO Monty Moran
       said on an earnings call.
       2. The chain is preparing tomatoes, lettuce, and bell peppers in a
       central kitchen so they can be tested.
       3. The company is still preparing onions, avocados, jalapenos, and
       limes in restaurants, but it is blanching those ingredients in
       boiling water to get rid of any harmful microbes before they are
       used to make guacamole and other items.
       4. Chipotle is using a new procedure for marinating chicken and
       steak, "which now happens distinct from and after the preparation
       of other fresh items" in resealable plastic bags, rather than
       bowls.
       5. The company is adding cilantro to its cooked rice immediately so
       the heat of the rice can kill germs.
       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the end to
       the E. coli outbreaks on Monday, but the impact on Chipotle is most
       likely far from over.
       The company's same-store sales, or sales at restaurants open at
       least a year, fell 14.6% in the fourth quarter that ended in
       December, and Chipotle said same-store sales fell another 36% in
       January.
       "The source of the outbreak has still not been conclusively
       identified," said Neil Saunders, CEO of the retail consulting firm
       Conlumino. "While it is unlikely that there will be a reoccurrence
       thanks to the extensive checks and safety processes Chipotle has
       put in place, the lack of a conclusive outcome will make it more
       difficult to rebuild consumer confidence."
