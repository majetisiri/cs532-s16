   It's Officially Safe to Eat at Chipotle Again

   It\'s Officially Safe to Eat at Chipotle Again

Laura Murray/Thrillist

   Finally, after months of grappling with a massive E. coli outbreak,
   Chipotle received an all-clear from federal health officials on Monday.
   In an update on its website, the Center for Disease Control &
   Prevention (CDC) officially [329]declared an end to the devastating
   outbreak, which sickened 55 people in 11 states -- 21 of whom were
   hospitalized -- since late last year. A [330]second, smaller E. coli
   outbreak linked to the chain, was also declared over.

   While the development is almost certainly great news for the embattled
   burrito chain, CDC investigators said they were unable to pinpoint the
   ingredient used in the affected restaurants that made so many people
   sick, meaning it will likely remain a mystery.

   "The epidemiologic evidence collected during this investigation
   suggested that a common meal item or ingredient served at Chipotle
   Mexican Grill restaurants was a likely source of both outbreaks," the
   CDC said. "The investigation did not identify a specific food or
   ingredient linked to illness." When the CDC declares an outbreak over,
   it means they've officially closed their investigation, according to a
   [331]report by The Wall Street Journal ahead of the CDC's update.

   All of this comes amid Chipotle's big push to lure customers back
   ([332]with free food!) into the folds of its warm tortillas, and just
   days before the company will close all of its restaurants for a few
   hours on February 8th for new food safety meetings and training.
   Chipotle's stock, which has [333]collapsed like a foil-less burrito in
   recent weeks, was already trading up almost 4% on Monday morning thanks
   to the news. However, Chipotle isn't exactly out of the woods,
   considering a recent criminal investigation into a norovirus outbreak
   at a California Chipotle restaurant, as well as facing pending
   [334]civil lawsuits.

   Hopefully, this means we won't have to hear about E. coli for a while
   now. Thrillist reached out to Chipotle for comment.
