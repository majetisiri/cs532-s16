   [6]Video: Tesla car summoned through Apple Watch
   short by Bhavika Bhuwalka / 04:15 pm on 05 Feb 2016,Friday
   iOS developer Allen Wong has created a third-party app called ‘Remote S
   for Tesla’ through which users can summon their Tesla cars through
   their Apple Watches. It also keeps a track of basic information
   including the car’s charging status, speed and temperature. Notably,
   Tesla’s 'Summon' feature enables the car to unpark itself out of the
   garage and arrive at the doorstep.
