   What's Next For Chipotle?

      After stumbling badly on negative publicity about foodborne illness at
      some of its restaurants, the fast casual dining industry's once
      unstoppable frontrunner finally caught a break: On February 1, the
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared Chipotle
      Mexican Grill (NYSE: [53]CMG) free of the nasty E. coli bug responsible
      for the illness outbreak.

      During the summer and fall of last year, the outbreak affected five
      dozen Chipotle customers in 11 states, prompting the temporary
      shut-down of 43 of the chain's locations. The situation has run its
      course, the CDC concluded, because no new cases have been reported
      since December 21.

      Besides sullying Chipotle's reputation for safely providing "food with
      integrity," the outbreak is wreaking havoc on the company's stock and
      financials. Shares of Chipotle fell more than 40% since the news broke,
      and its latest quarterly report can only be described as ugly. Plus,
      there's still fallout from a couple other recent outbreaks with another
      foodborne microbe (norovirus) involving single Chipotle locations in
      California and Massachusetts.

      Yet this all amounts to what may well be the best value opportunity of
      the year. To be sure, it will take time for Chipotle to mend fences
      with customers and resume impressive growth. But I'm confident it will.

      History Favors Chipotle
      There's historic precedent for this optimism involving rivals that,
      frankly, don't hold a candle to Chipotle. For example, an E. coli
      outbreak more than 20 years ago at fast food chain Jack in the Box
      (Nasdaq: [54]JACK) is long forgotten even though it was far more
      serious, affecting 732 people and causing four deaths. Today, the chain
      still has annual revenue of more than $1.5 billion, and its stock is up
      about 12-fold since the outbreak.

      Only a few years ago, Yum Brands (NYSE: [55]YUM) subsidiary Taco Bell
      was linked to a salmonella outbreak that infected 68 people and sent 20
      to the hospital. Yet Taco Bell, too, continues to thrive, expanding
      aggressively domestically and abroad, generating more than $1.8 billion
      in annual revenue and posting solid organic sales growth.

      Apparently, investors were already starting to forgive Chipotle a few
      weeks ago. After hitting more than a two-year low in mid-January, its
      stock rallied strongly despite a stubborn downtrend in the broader
      market. Shares could face more selling pressure in the near-term,
      though, thanks to fresh publicity woes. A few days ago, authorities
      announced that a criminal investigation of food safety practices during
      Chipotle's California norovirus outbreak would be expanded nationwide.

      However, management should help stem the blow by continuing to publicly
      accept responsibility for all the recent outbreaks and offer full
      cooperation with authorities. It's also proceeding with food safety
      program improvements such as testing ingredients for foodborne germs
      throughout the supply chain, working with suppliers to improve their
      food safety programs, enhancing sanitation procedures at all Chipotle
      locations and increasing employee food safety training. Marketing
      efforts are stressing management's zero tolerance for foodborne
      illness.

      Tough Q4... But A Bright Future
      Chipotle's fourth-quarter report on February 2 was as bad as analysts
      expected in light of recent events. Revenue was down 7% to $998 million
      and net income sank 44% to $68 million for the quarter.
      Comparable-restaurant sales, defined by Chipotle as sales at locations
      open at least 13 months, fell 14.6% -- a shocking decline considering
      the company's long track record of double-digit gains in this key
      growth metric.

      Still, the quarter wasn't a total disaster. At the restaurant level,
      Chipotle held operating margins to less than a one-point drop at a
      still enviable 19.6%, with help from higher menu prices and lower
      ingredient costs. The company added 79 new locations, bringing the
      total to 2,010.

      And it still managed solid full-year performance, including gains of
      almost 10% and 7% in revenue and net income to $4.5 billion and $476
      million, respectively. The past year's net margin, 11.6%, is Chipotle's
      highest in a least a decade. Twelve-month returns on assets and equity
      also sit at or near decade highs.

      Such data reflect fierce customer loyalty, especially among youths.
      While visits to Chipotle fell 5% overall in 2015, teens and young
      adults increased their visits by double-digits for the year, reports
      New York-based market research firm NPD Group. That bodes well for a
      fairly swift turnaround at Chipotle because the younger demographic
      accounts for the greatest share of foot traffic, and its spending power
      is on the rise.

      Another positive sign: On February 3, Wells Fargo upgraded Chipotle to
      "outperform" with a $500-to-$530 price target, citing case study
      analyses showing that most of the restaurants dogged by food-safety
      issues in the past 25 years went on to recover. That price target
      implies roughly 6%-to-11% near-term upside for Chipotle's stock.

      Risks to Consider: The outcome of the criminal investigation of
      Chipotle remains unknown, and the company could be hit with numerous
      lawsuits from E. coli and norovirus-exposed customers. Financials are
      likely to suffer for a while, with most analysts forecasting
      double-digit shrinkage of earnings this year as Chipotle struggles to
      win back public trust. Also, the exact source of the outbreaks was
      never discovered, so foodborne illness problems could resurface.

      Action to Take: Foodborne illness is rare at restaurant chains, and
      lesser restaurants have come through much worse incidents than Chipotle
      faces now. History and investor sentiment suggest the current damage to
      its reputation and financials is temporary, positioning the company for
      a relatively quick turnaround. This gives value investors an uncommon
      opportunity to own shares of the fast casual movement's long-time
      undisputed leader at prices not seen since late 2013.
