Chipotle Closes Stores for Employee Meeting

   [96]Two Charlottesville Chipotle locations are among the nearly 2,000
   stores nationwide that will close for a few hours on Monday morning for
   a company-wide meeting on the recent issues of food poisoning.

   CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA (NEWSPLEX) -- Both Charlottesville Chipotle
   locations will be closed for a few hours on Monday morning to address
   recent issues of food poisoning.

   There were no episodes of food poisoning at either local Chipotle, but
   dozens of people were sickened by E.coli after eating at Chipotle
   locations in nine other states.

   The company is closing almost 2,000 stores Monday morning for a meeting
   on food safety. The restaurant's trouble hasn't stopped many local
   Chipotle regulars from stopping in for a burrito.

   "I think it's a good deal," said Gerry Newman, who was eating lunch on
   Friday at the Barracks Road location.

   Newman says he and his wife share a lunch at the chain once a week.

   "I think it's a good deal," he said. "They probably have good clean
   practices but just had some mistakes happen."

   In addition to the E. coli contamination, Chipotle locations in other
   states had outbreaks of norovirus. The company's stock has dropped
   sharply as a result.
