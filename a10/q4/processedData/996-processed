Chipotle's half-day closure is another sign the company just doesn't get it

   February 05, 2016 by Dan Hill, Ervin Hill Strategy , [68]Be the first
   to comment

   "Consumers expect and deserve food safety - today - not just some time
   in the future."
   [69]Opinion

   [70]"Chipotle is closing every single one of its locations starting
   next month," tweeted Teen Vogue on January 23.

   The misleading tweet was one of hundreds like it after Chipotle made
   its latest misstep in handling its food-safety crisis. In perhaps its
   most embarrassing miscalculation, the company announced in mid-January
   that was closing all of its stores on February 8, temporarily, to
   address "food safety" and "outbreaks" with its employees.

   The company's [71]own release highlighted that new food-safety
   procedures were only "largely in place."

   With those ill-conceived words, Chipotle further confirmed its
   inability to get a handle on the protracted crisis. Why would a company
   keep its doors open if its current food-safety standards were
   inadequate and the new procedures were not yet implemented?

   I can envision a company saying it is "redoubling its efforts" or
   "reinforcing procedures that are already in place," but to say new
   procedures are not fully implemented is a big mistake for a company
   still operating.

   Consumers expect and deserve food safety – today – not just some time
   in the future.

   Perhaps the burrito brand was stealing a play from Starbucks. In 2008,
   the coffee brand's chairman and CEO, Howard Schultz, closed all 7,100
   locations for a few hours to discuss "excellence in espresso" and his
   plan to regain the company’s "soul of the past."

   Schultz was rightly praised for his move to aggressively address
   quality issues such as the scent of its breakfast food overpowering the
   smell of its coffee. However, Chipotle is facing a major crisis, with
   hundreds having fallen ill from its food at locations across the
   country. Starbucks was on the offense as it owned its challenge.

   Now is no time for cute tactics. Under the intense microscope of a
   crisis, each move must be measured and flawlessly executed.

   The food chain should have held its all-hands meeting before announcing
   it; it could have found a way to do it after hours, even if it required
   rolling meetings by region.

   "Last night we spoke to every employee" is a message of leadership. "In
   a few weeks, we will close all locations to address food safety" is the
   message of a company that simply does not get it.
