Chipotle outbreak probe expands systemwide

   Federal investigators have expanded the scope of their criminal
   investigation into Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.’s food-safety practices
   from one store in California where a norovirus sickened dozens of
   customers last August to a systemwide probe that includes all the
   Denver-based chain’s restaurants.

   Investigators with the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies
   are probing Chipotle’s food safety practices dating back to the start
   of 2013, company officials said Feb. 2 of a subpoena the company
   received Jan. 28. The company pledged to cooperate fully with
   investigators.

   News of the expanded criminal investigation came one day after the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the E. coli outbreak
   linked to the burrito chain “appeared to be over.”

   A series of E. coli and norovirus outbreaks tied to Chipotle
   restaurants at various locations across the country sickened more than
   500 people in the past six months, U.S. health officials said.

   Federal investigators and company officials are not commenting on the
   ongoing criminal investigation.

   Bill Marler, a Seattle attorney representing about 100 customers who
   became ill after eating at Chipotle, told Reuters he thought the
   expanded investigation could focus on what officials at Chipotle’s
   headquarters knew about food-safety conditions at restaurants across
   the country and when.

   On Feb. 8, Chipotle plans to close its 2,000 restaurants until 3 p.m.
   to discuss food safety with its employees nationwide.

   In December, Chipotle officials said the company would prepare
   tomatoes, lettuce and bell peppers in a central kitchen and blanch
   avocados, onions, jalapenos and citrus.

   In addition to those practices, the chain now will marinate chopped
   onions, jalapenos and cilantro in citrus juice when it makes salsas and
   guacamole as an added food safety measure, chairman and co-CEO Steve
   Ells said Feb. 2 during a conference call to discuss Chipotle’s fourth
   quarter and year-end 2015 earnings.

   The chain also will undertake a new way of marinating chicken and steak
   that is distinct from preparation of other fresh items, Ells said
   during the call.

   Chipotle is expanding its in-restaurant auditing programs and taking
   the changes “very seriously,” Monty Moran, co-CEO, said during the
   call.

   “Beginning in 2016, scores from our third-party auditor will account
   for half of our managers’ bonuses,” Moran said during the call.

   The outbreaks caused Chipotle sales to plummet 14.6% in the fourth
   quarter, marking the first decline since the company went public in
   2006. Its stock tumbled from a high of $758.61 last August before the
   outbreaks to $404.26 Jan. 12. Chipotle stock was trading at $461.92
   early Feb. 4.

   “The fourth quarter was without question the most challenging in our
   history, but we have responded and have implemented an industry-leading
   food safety program that reduces our food safety risk to as low to zero
   as possible,” Ells said during the call.

   Despite slumping sales, the pace of new restaurant openings was not
   affected by recent events, Ells said on the conference call. Chipotle
   added 79 restaurants in the fourth quarter and 229 for the year,
   bringing the chain’s total to 2,010 restaurants. The company
   anticipates opening another 220 restaurants in 2016.

   Chipotle plans to unveil a $50 million marketing and advertising
   campaign for the first quarter of 2016 — the largest marketing blitz in
   company history — to lure customers.

   “As we emerge from this difficult time, we can focus on what will be
   our primary objective for 2016: making sure our food is as safe as
   possible and welcoming customers back to our restaurants as our teams
   deliver an extraordinary dining experience,” Ells said during the
   conference call.
