     Tonight I logged into My Tesla, and instead of my order status I see
     an opportunity to order a Model S or reserve a Model X. Nothing
     anywhere about my S that should be nearing production. Plus the info
     they show for me has the old phone and address from nearly two years
     ago. No sign of the updated info I input earlier this year, let
     alone my insurance card and DL scans.
     That last website update seems to have unleashed a whole host of
     issues.

     Mine me looks fine. Are you sure you aren't just seeing an old stale
     cache on you browser?

     Yes. I did a page refresh and it didn't change. I also logged off
     and then back on. Plus I wasn't even using this browser when I had
     the old address.
     Maybe it will fix itself by tomorrow.

     Now it's seems fixed. I don't know what happened.

     Tesla seemed to be making some rather significant changes to My
     Tesla the last week or two, so I wouldn't worry about your actual
     order too much. You can always contact your Delivery Specialist if
     you have questions before your MS arrives -- assuming you have had
     one assigned already. Good luck on the waiting -- it's the hardest
     part the whole process!

     I see weirdness as well - the forum links are gone, service purchase
     links just go to the root of MyTesla, etc. Looks like there's a
     re-design in progress that's kind of half-assed. I wouldn't worry
     about it.

     I'm surprised at how long the Tesla Motors web site has been in
     flux. They warned that the forums were going off-line, but this is
     going on nearly a week now. I wonder what the problem is?

     Somewhat ironic don't you think that a tech-based, silicone-valley
     company like Tesla, run by a computer coder, that made his fortune
     from designing web sites can't keep a web-site up and running. In
     today's world you make amends to the site THEN go live with it not
     take the existing one down to mess around. Does make you realise why
     the new releases for the Model S take so long.....

     Have you tried running the new website using the car's browser?
     Still a few items that don't work...
     And it looks like the forums may be gone. Which is OK, with the TMC
     forum, there really isn't a need any more for Tesla to have their
     own forums - and waste resources managing the content. Though there
     is still a broken link on the software updates page pointing to the
     forums (it takes you back to the home page).
