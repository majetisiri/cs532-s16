   [141]/r/technology is a place to share and discuss the latest
   developments, happenings and curiosities in the world of technology; a
   broad spectrum of conversation as to the innovations, aspirations,
   applications and machinations that define our age and shape our future.

Rules:

1. Submissions

     * Guidelines:
     * Submissions must be primarily news and developments relating to
       technology
     * Self posts must contribute positively to [142]/r/technology and
       foster reasonable discussion.
     * Submissions relating to business and politics must be sufficiently
       within the context of technology in that they either view the
       events from a technological standpoint or analyse the repercussions
       in the technological world.
     * Please do not submit the following:
     * i) Submissions violating the guidelines.
     * ii) Images, audio or videos: Articles with supporting image and
       video content are allowed; if the text is only there to explain the
       media, then it is not suitable. A good rule of thumb is to look at
       the URL; if it's a video hosting site, or mentions video in the
       URL, it's not suitable.
     * iii) Requests for tech support, questions or help: submit to
       [143]/r/techsupport, [144]/r/AskTechnology, another relevant
       community or our weekly Support Saturday threads.
     * iv) Petitions, Surveys or Crowdfunding - submissions of this nature
       will be removed.
     * v) Submissions discussing the subreddit itself; they should be
       submitted to [145]/r/TechnologyTalk, or [146]messaged to the
       moderators of the subreddit.
     * vi) Submissions discussing one or more incidents of customer
       support.
     * vii) Mobile versions of sites, url shorteners: please directly
       submit the desktop version of a webpage in all cases.

2. Behaviour

     * Remember the human You are advised to abide by [147]reddiquette; it
       will be enforced when user behavior is no longer deemed to be
       suitable for a technology forum. Remember; personal attacks,
       abusive language, trolling or bigotry in any form are therefore not
       allowed and will be removed.

3. Titles

     * Submissions must use either the articles title, or a suitable
       quote, either of which must:
     * adequately describe the content
     * adequately describe the content's relation to technology
     * be free of user editorialization or alteration of meaning.

4. Flair

     * Please flair your submission appropriately. [148]An extended guide
       to flairing can be found here, in the wiki.

5. Reddit-wide rules.

     * [149]All reddit-wide rules apply here. Do not post personal
       information; no facebook or social media links. Do not [150]spam.
     __________________________________________________________________

Miscellanea

     * If you see a rule-breaking submission, please report it and
       [151]message the moderators with your reason.
     * Want to host an AMA? Please [152]message the moderators.
     * Our [153]/u/AutoModerator configuration may be viewed [154]here.
     * Removed threads will either be given a removal reason flair or
       comment response; please message the moderators if this did not
       occur.
     * All legitimate, answerable modmail inquiries or suggestions will be
       answered to the best of our abilities within a reasonable period of
       time.
     * Rule violators will be warned. Repeat offenders will be temporarily
       banned from one to seven days. An unheeded final warning will
       result in a permanent ban. This may be reversed upon evidence of
       suitable behavior.
