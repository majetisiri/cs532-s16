7 Real Companies Just as Evil as New Tesla in Dimension W

   [5]List by [6]Jenbae - Feb 5th, 2016
   [7]gbx1_march2016_top

   Dimension W is an intriguing anime set in the future where unlimited
   energy is possible through borrowing energy from a different dimension
   (of course it's called 'Dimension W').


   At the core of the story is the mystery surrounding the devices called
   "coils" which borrow the energy from Dimension W. The massive, global
   New Tesla company is the creator of the coils and let's just say, they
   are out for blood and billions.

   "More please!"

   So they're basically just like these 7 corrupt but rich as hell
   companies.


Monsanto

   Monsanto is a pesticide manufacturer. Before genetically modified crops
   (GMOs) were used widely, the company claimed that if you planted their
   special seeds and used their strong pesticide then everything bad will
   die (like all the bugs and weeds) but not the crops. There were no
   studies that backed up that claim at the time.

   They also dumped tens of thousands of pounds of a toxic pollutant known
   as PCB in the waterways of Anniston, Alabama causing the highest build
   up of the pollutant ever. When caught they said “We can’t afford to
   lose a dollar of profit” and they were convicted in 2002.

   A lot of people got sick and died.



Walmart

   Called by some a 'necessary evil' in a globalized world and the 'scum
   of the earth' by others, everyone knows this company. There are many
   stories where Walmart came into small towns, aggressively dropped
   prices until the smaller stores went out of businesses then they
   lowered wages for the workers and raised prices for the town.

   They run sweatshops, have refused to hire women for open positions, use
   illegal workers , and are known for not paying employees a livable wage
   so many need food stamps to feed their family. They also got mixed up
   in a [8]human trafficking scandal with one of their supply partners
   where workers were kidnapped.

   Walmart: it's so cheap because people are literally being forced to
   work for them!


Comcast and Time Warner


   These two could win the award for "Most likely to steal your Internet
   access."

   They've taken millions from the American government to lay down fiber
   optic cables (which would make Internet and TV super fast). Instead
   they've kept the money, didn't lay the amount of cables they were
   supposed to and they throttle data while charging people extra.

   They've been trying to kill Netflix, actively conspire with each other
   so there are no other options for people to choose from, and they've
   spent so much money lobbying that they have [9]changed laws that help
   them keep a monopoly. And yeah, they're growing and expanding around
   the world while trying to do everything they can to kill competitors
   while overcharging us for Internet.

   Bye, Internet! It was fun!


Bayer

   Bayer is a German chemical and pharmaceutical company founded in 1863.
   Their first and best known product is Asprin. They also sold the (now
   illegal) drug heroin as a cough suppressant and non-addictive
   substitute for morphine from 1898 to 1910. They also gave a lot of
   people AIDS.

   In 1984, Bayer discovered one of their products was infecting people
   with HIV. So they stopped selling the product in America and shipped
   all the product they had in stock to Asia and Latin America. They also
   kept making the drug for a few more months just because.

   At least 100,000 units were shipped overseas.


De Beers Diamond Corporation

   [wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==]

   Do you remember in 2006 when the Blood Diamond movie with Leonardo
   DiCaprio came out and the whole world realized how evil diamond mining
   is? Yeah, people seem to have stopped caring after a few years.

   In 1938, this company marketed aggressively saying that only real men
   give diamond rings. The rule that "you have to spend two months salary
   on a ring" is actually from an old De Beers campaign. They have a
   monopoly on diamonds and restrict the sale of diamonds to artificially
   create demand. Many of the places where diamonds come from have been
   taken over by warlords who kidnap people to be slaves and are forced to
   dig in the mud with their bare hands to unearth diamonds.

   It's still ongoing today.


Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation

   HSBC was founded in the 19th century to "take care" of the profits
   British groups were making from the Opium trade in China. And by "take
   care" I mean killing anyone who would report on it, say it was morally
   wrong or suggest banning it. With high profits and low ethics, they
   survived all the way to current day and now they help fund [11]Mexican
   drug cartels and launder money for terrorists.

   When you hear on TV about terrorism and drug cartels murdering people,
   remember it's only possible with the help of bankers of HSBC!


Nestle

   Do you buy from Perrier, Wonka, or Purina? Then you've been helping
   fund possibly the most evil corporation in the world with the longest
   [12]consumer boycott ever.

   Nestle is hated for their practice of going into poor,
   developing countries and promoting powdered baby formula which requires
   water to mix into a liquid for babies to drink. They gave away the
   formula for free, claiming it was superior to breast milk and many
   women switched, hoping to raise healthier children. By using the
   formula, the mother's weren't breast feeding and they stopped
   lactating. When the free powdered formula ran out, the mothers had to
   start buying the powder since it was the only way to feed their
   child. In many of the targeted communities, there wasn't access to
   clean water so many babies died.

   Feeding babies with formula is responsible for around 1.5 million
   infant deaths every year, from lack of adequate sanitation, lack of
   nutrition from over-diluted milk formula, and an absence of nutrients
   commonly found in breastmilk. Formula isn't healthier than breast
   feeding and this story caused a huge public backlash on the company.

   Nestle also:
     * Is the largest producer of bottled water in the world and tried to
       get people's right to water reclassified as a need instead of a
       right
     * Have been caught siphoning water without a permit and are involved
       with multiple environmental damage cases
     * Buys cocoa for chocolate from plantations that use
       kidnapped African child slaves who sometimes are worked to death
     * Demanded Ethiopia pay back a debt of US$6 million (incurred by a
       1977 military regime which seized Nestle assets in the country)
       when Ethiopia was suffering from an intense famine
     * Is known for taking old food and repackaging it with a new sell-by
       date for sale in other countries. It also mislabels health
       guidelines while saying their products are for the most part
       healthy when a 2015 report shows that 7 out of the 15 breakfast
       cereals with the highest levels of sugar, fat, and salt were Nestle
       products.

   So a lot of people don't like Nestle but they have so many subsidiary
   companies that they are still making billions. In fact each of these
   Nestle subsidiary companies make over $1.1 billion a
   year: Nespresso, Nescafé, Kit
   Kat, Smarties, Nesquik, Stouffer’s, Vittel, and Maggi. That's just 8
   brands, they own over 8,000 different brands. Basically, they own half
   the grocery store.


   These global companies have the money to make anyone and anything
   disappear plus they've been merging more and more (making them even
   more rich). So as you watch Dimension W and hear things like the New
   Tesla company covered up a few deaths or an entire town was destroyed,
   remember it happens in our world too since some companies have enough
   money to make anything disappear.


   There are more corrupt companies in the world than the 7 discussed
   (hey, it is the easiest way to make money) but hopefully people like
   Kyouma will stomp them down.
