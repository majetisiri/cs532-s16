   This Easy Chipotle Mango Salsa is sweet with a hint of heat and it has
   just 3 ingredients! The perfect addition to some killer vegan nachos!

   This post is sponsored by [21]Beanfields Snacks. As always, all
   opinions are my own. I really love their [22]Bean & Rice Chips, and am
   very excited to share them with you (which is why I am working with
   Beanfields Snacks.) These chips ROCK!

   I have been a fan of homemade fruit salsa ever since I had the salsa
   that inspired me to make [23]this pineapple kiwi salsa. I love the
   crisp bite and fresh sweet flavors. Plus they are super easy to make.

   This Chipotle Mango Salsa is no different, and it only has 3
   ingredients. It is SO easy to make! All you have to do is dice up some
   red onion and ripe mango and then toss in a finely chopped chipotle
   pepper in adobo sauce.

   A note about canned chipotle peppers‚Ä¶ Sometimes gluten is hiding in
   there so be sure to double check the labeling and pick a can of
   chipotle peppers that you feel safe with. I picked a can that didn‚Äôt
   have
   ‚Äúspices‚Äù listed in the ingredients. But I have had some cans that did
   have ‚Äúspices‚Äù listed in the ingredients and been just fine. So I am
   just giving you a heads up to double check your can of chipotles.

   Ok, not that I‚Äôve said that bit, I want to tell you how much I love
   chipotle peppers! There is so much smoky, spicy, flavor packed into a
   chipotle pepper! A chipotle pepper is actually a jalepeno that has been
   smoked. It comes in a little can with several peppers in a smoky sauce
   called ‚Äúadobo.‚Äù Both the peppers and the sauce that they come in really
   pack a punch of heat and smoke, making them the perfect contrast to the
   sweet mango in the salsa.

   Now that we have your chipotle mango salsa covered, you need something
   to dip in it, right?

   I have been so excited to share these [27]Bean & Rice Chips from
   Beanfields Snacks with you. I have kinda fallen in love with them! My
   kids and husband devour them. Not only are the gluten-free but they are
   also corn-free (YAY!) and vegan (double-YAY!) meaning that they are
   dairy-free too. YES, even the fun flavored Bean & Rice Chips like Nacho
   (it reminds me of hubby‚Äôs favorite nacho flavored chip), and Ranch are
   dairy-free. I don‚Äôt think I can pick a favorite flavor. They have some
   simpler flavors (like Unsalted, Sea Salt, and Salt & Pepper) and I love
   the unadulterated taste and crunch that they have. That is why I ate a
   bag of Sea Salt Bean & Rice Chips with my salsa. The more adventurous
   flavors (like the Ranch, Barbecue, Pico de Gallo, and Nacho) usually
   get devoured straight from the bag.

   Not to mention, all the Bean & Rice Chip flavors have 6 grams of fiber,
   4.5 grams of fat, and 5 grams of protein per serving (complete protein
   too since they are made with beans and rice.) They are  Non-GMO Project
   Verified and made by a family-owned company. They really are a
   better-for-you snack that you can feel good sharing with your family
   and friends.

   has just 3 ingredients!

   Valentine‚Äôs Day is right around the corner, and what better way to show
   them you car than by sharing some Bean & Rice Chips with them. Bonus
   points if you make them some fresh Chipotle Mango Salsa to bring some
   ‚Äúsweet and heat.‚Äù

   [29]Easy Vegan Nachos with Chipotle Mango Salsa. Sweet with a hint of
   heat and the salsa has just 3 ingredients!


   And you can always up-the-ante by using your Beanfields Snacks Rice &
   Bean Chips to make some dairy-free vegan nachos. Just put a layer of
   chips on a baking sheet (I like to line my pan with parchment paper for
   easy clean-up) and sprinkle it with your favorite dairy-free/vegan
   cheese shreds. Bake at 375F just until the cheese starts to melt! Then
   serve with the chipotle mango salsa for the perfect [30]appetizer to
   share with your sweetheart.

       Good catch on the adobo sauce, Brianna. I published a recipe in
       Gluten Free & More a couple years ago calling for chili peppers in
       adobo sauce and a reader wrote in insisting that they contained
       gluten. All the brands I‚Äôd seen were GF, but apparently there was a
       brand out there that contained gluten. You just never know!
       Yummy recipe!

            Thanks Jules!
            I only know about Adobo because I shared a recipe with
            chipotles in it and someone in my local Celiac Support Group
            told me. I have never seen canned chipotles with gluten, but I
            am a little paranoid when I post something on my blog with
            chipotle now. Better safe than sorry!
