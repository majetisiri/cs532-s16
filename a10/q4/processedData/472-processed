   As [14]Chipotle Mexican Grill [15]tries to [16]recover from a series of
   contaminations that have caused some customers and investors to flee,
   it said it would shut all its stores for several hours on Feb. 8 to
   hold [17]food safety meetings with employees.

   “We are hosting a national team meeting to thank our employees for
   their hard work through this difficult time, discuss some of the
   [18]food safety changes we are implementing, and answer questions from
   employees,” Chris Arnold, a Chipotle spokesman, said in an email. The
   stores will open at 3 p.m., later than the usual start time of about 10
   a.m. or 11 a.m., skipping the lunch hour rush on a Monday.

   The restaurant chain, which has more than 2,000 locations and has
   created an identity based largely on using locally grown, fresh
   ingredients, has been contending with a [19]series of [20]E. coli
   outbreaks. Five customers in Seattle became ill with the bacteria in
   July, and there have been at least six outbreaks in the last six
   months.

   Chipotle indicated last week that the federal authorities were
   [21]pursuing a criminal case. The company said it had received a grand
   jury subpoena related to a norovirus outbreak that sickened 234 people
   in Simi Valley, Calif., in August. Chipotle has said that outbreak and
   [22]another in Boston that affected at least 136 customers in December
   were caused by sick employees who ignored company policies that
   prohibited them from working.

   More than 500 people [24]are estimated to have become ill after eating
   in Chipotle restaurants in the second half of 2015.

   The company [25]said in December that it may never know what caused an
   E. coli outbreak in November linked to two restaurants in Kansas and
   Oklahoma. “If there’s a silver lining in this, it is that by not
   knowing for sure what the cause is, it’s prompted us to look at every
   ingredient we use with an eye to improving our practices,” Mr. Arnold
   [26]said this week.

   “We did a really comprehensive review of food safety practices from
   farm to restaurants,” he added. “From that assessment we developed a
   food safety plan, which we hope will establish Chipotle as a leader in
   food safety.”

   Chipotle’s same-store sales dropped by 14.6 percent in the last
   quarter.
