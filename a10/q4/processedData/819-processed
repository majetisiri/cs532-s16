   Tesla Energy launches Powerwall

Tesla Powerwall begins to ship, what does this mean?

   Tesla Energy’s Powerwall has to started to ship on a global scale with
   customers in Australia receiving the first of the company’s lithium-ion
   battery packs designed to power homes.

   The Gigafactory 1, the world’s biggest lithium-ion battery plant in
   Nevada and manufacturing home to the Powerwall,  is also only weeks
   away from its official launch.

   Here we revisit our five takeaway points on Tesla’s foray into the
   utility industry, as first published in #Benchmark2, our second
   published issue.

   1. Tesla is a market creator

   The showmanship exhibited by Elon Musk and the marketing approach by
   Tesla Motors has generated excitement that has never been seen in the
   EV or battery industries. Within one week of its utility battery launch
   the company received 38,000 Powerwall and 2,500 Powerpack reservations.

   It is important to note that no deposit was required so this number can
   be considered more a statement of intent to buy rather than an order.
   Still, it was a gauge of just how excited the retail market was on the
   launch of what is a simple battery system.

   2. Tesla is making change affordable and easy

   Getting the retail market to buy en masse is some challenge.

   Installing a battery system to power your home is not as simple as plug
   in and go. It will require a qualified electrician to connect your home
   to an inverter to make the power usable – converting from direct to
   alternate current. All of this equates to time, money and effort which
   deters individual buyers.

   Tesla, however, is making the process easy, more affordable than what
   is presently on the market and, most of all, desirable.

   3. Battery technology alone is not yet good enough

   Today’s lithium-ion batteries are not yet good enough to satisfy the
   needs of new markets. In Elon Musk’s words they “suck” and are “really
   horrible”.

   This however is being offset by innovation – increasingly intelligent
   software management systems and more aerodynamic and lightweight EV
   design, for example.

   With increasing R&D spend going into improved battery cathode and anode
   technology, all focused on producing a more dense but lighter weight
   battery, trends in better battery chemistry and effective energy
   storage management are converging.

   4. Gigafactory may just be the start

   Benchmark has always stressed that batteries are not just about EVs.
   The wide range of battery uses today gives an indication of where the
   market can go.

   Bigger and better batteries are needed to expand into markets such as
   retail and commercial energy storage. But the reaction to Tesla’s
   launch means the western public could be willing to accept a bigger
   role for batteries in their everyday lives.

   Perhaps the most dramatic impact will be seen in Africa, India and
   South-East Asia where access to power is not as widespread as in
   developed economies, but conditions for solar energy are good to
   optimal. Using a battery to store this renewable energy could
   dramatically change the way developing nations use power.

   This will result in a step change for demand of lithium-ion batteries
   and with it the need for significant increases in output.

   The Gigafactory is looking to double the world’s output of lithium-ion
   cells when it reaches capacity in 2020, while a wide range of battery
   majors are also planning significant expansion or new plants, nearly
   all of which are in China.

   When Elon Musk referred to the Gigafactory as “Gigafactory one” many
   would have, at a minimum, been surprised at his ambition. But today’s
   battery industry has been built to produce cells for smartphones and
   laptops, not the significantly bigger EVs and commercial storage units.
   If these markets take off in any serious way, the battery industry will
   be an entirely different place.

   5. Tesla cannot do this alone

   It is best to look at Tesla as a catalyst for change rather than the
   sole defining factor.

   There is only so much one company can achieve in changing the way the
   world uses energy.

   The reaction from other companies such as Nissan and Panasonic to
   launch their own competing products would have been welcomed by Tesla.
   With some of the world’s biggest corporations now behind energy storage
   in both EVs and utility sectors, significant change could be on the
   horizon.

   More products and more competition usually results in lower costs for
   the consumer. This will have a positive impact on future battery
   demand.

One thought on “Tesla Powerwall begins to ship, what does this mean?”

       Great article, thanks but questions pops up when reading this as a
       simple logistician.
       Have these home batteries been utterly tested and certified to be
       used ? There will be detailed national rules & laws to follow which
       differ sometimes from country to country.
       So Tesla is going to ship these home batteries on a global scale.
       Wonder if these batteries are listed as hazardous by IMO
       regulations or not ? This can have a certain impact on their export
       logistics.
       Still, amazing development. Also in the tiny Netherlands, you can
       order out similar home batteries.
