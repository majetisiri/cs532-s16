   Charging protocols and standards are fuelling an ever evolving debate
   in the electric vehicle industry. Some are calling for a global
   standard, while others are just fine with multiple
   infrastructure efforts using different adapters. Where does Tesla fit
   in this debate? The company has been developing its own charging
   infrastructure called “[34]Superchargers“, while offering a range of
   adapters to let Tesla owners use other charging networks. [INS: :INS]

   After the publication of a new patent application today, we learn that
   Tesla is working on an inter-protocol charging adapter capable
   of supporting both CHAdeMO and SAE J1772. Based on its open-source
   patent pledge made last year, the company applies for patents only to
   protect itself against potential attempts at blocking its technology,
   while promising not to sue anyone using its patented electric vehicle
   technology in good faith.

   In its application, Tesla describes its inter-protocol charging
   adapter:

     An inter-protocol charging adapter for equipment to be charged via a
     bus includes: first connectors corresponding to a first charging
     protocol that requires the bus to be energized before the equipment
     closes onto the bus; second connectors corresponding to a second
     charging protocol that does not energize the bus before the
     equipment closes onto the bus; and a boost converter coupled to the
     bus and to at least one of the second connectors, wherein the boost
     converter uses energy from the second connector to energize the bus
     before the equipment closes onto the bus.

   The company included a few schematics with its patent application:

   [35]20160036256_05
   [36]20160036256_04
   [37]20160036256_02
   [38]20160036256_03

   As the inventors describes in the application, much like Tesla’s own
   protocol, the SAE J1772 standard specifies that the bus must be
   energized by the time the contactors close onto the bus. While on the
   other hand, CHAdeMO expects the bus to be non-energized.

   Tesla’s adapter would be able to support both standard and trigger a
   “boost converter” to energize the bus.

   You can see the full patent application [39]here.

   Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been vocal about wanting to let other
   automakers use Tesla’s network of fast-charging stations. He said in a
   [40]recent meeting in Paris:

     “We want to do anything we can to help the advent of sustainable
     transport – so our network is open to any other manufacturer that
     want to use it. “

   He also said that the company plans to add the European standard plug
   at its Supercharger stations in Europe so that other electric
   manufacturers will be able to offer access without having to use a
   Tesla adapter.

   Last year, Musk confirmed that Tesla was [41]in talks with “some [auto]
   manufacturers” to share the Supercharger network, but without
   specifying which automakers.

       In Europa tesla already uses the Standard connector. This is a
       mannekens with out the additional pins.
       This is required by European law and makes elon a bit piissed
       because the Tesla adapter can carry more power then the default
       European adapter can.

            It is not required by law. Nissan and Kia does not use it
            either. They have Type 1 (J1772) and CHAdeMO.

            The Combo2 (which is incorrectly referred to as Type2 and also
            standard in Europe) is capable of delivering 150 kW power, and
            they are working on the 350 kW standard (with the same plug
            type). But it’s to big to hide behind Tesla’s small charge
            port. :-)

               o [61]František Kubiš Jr. - 3 months ago
                 Combo is currently rated only for 50kW, but in theory can
                 handle more for sure.

                 My bad, you’re true! Currently it’s 50 kW. The 150 kW
                 version was only shown but hasn’t been standardized yet.

               o [65]swaans - 1 month ago
                 150kW is misleading as right now that requires 750+ volts
                 which no cars on the road support. All cars now are 400V
                 or less and it makes little sense to double the voltage
                 due to dangers/precautions involved.

            As far I know, Supercharger maximum power in USA is 120KW, but
            Supercharger maximum power in Europe is 135KW… the european
            connector allows for higher power (more than 10% extra) so you
            are wrong.

       Should Tesla just make a probe of installing Super duper charger
       based on per-pay-use platform in city centers, e.g. Frankfurt
       Hamburg Essen, Paris Lyon Bordeaux Lyon, Vienna, Milan Verona etc.,
       only then we would be able to see real Tesla demand in Europe.
       Substitute chargers won’t make satisfactory result.

       Correction for plug types:
       In the center picture the right one what you referred to as
       “Mennekes without optional pins” is the Type2 (they’re basically
       the same thing). The left one is the Combo2 what is a Type2 with DC
       fast charge (additional pins). Fundamentally it’s the same as Combo
       what is a J1772 (Type1) with the same DC fast charge capability.

       IMO you are misreading and misunderstanding that patent.
       It’s from 2013 and it’s describing the CHAdeMO adaptor, which they
       have since built and released. The fact it references SAE J1772 DC
       is simply because they are trying to write the patent in the most
       general terms possible, for obvious reasons.
       The patent is specifically about a piece of functionality that
       would *not* be needed to build a Tesla-CCS adaptor (since both
       Tesla and CCS expect the HV bus to be energised before contactor
       close, unlike CHAdeMO).
