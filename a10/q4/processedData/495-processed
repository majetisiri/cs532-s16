roasted king oyster mushroom tacos w/ chipotle cacao sauce

   it!
   I think the universe has been sending out invitations to tell me
   secrets this week, but I’ve just been blowing it off to wash my hair or
   something. Lots of deep, intuitive feelings about career and life
   decisions that I just kept pushing down in an attempt to look/feel like
   I had all the answers. I had a cache of paperwork, decisions, and
   upcoming stuff that I had been sitting on and deliberating over for a
   couple weeks. These things were cluttering up my inbox, but they were
   also passive-aggressively shoving over my ability to stay present.

   A couple mornings ago, on a total whim, I deleted Facebook, Twitter,
   and Pinterest off of my phone and tablet in an attempt to shut out a
   bit of the noise. Then, I spent that day working on new recipes,
   drinking lots of tea, and listening to some of my favourite podcasts. I
   was in a good place of workflow and inspiration with hardly any
   distractions. That evening, when I started making dinner, I felt this
   unbelievable sense of clarity. I suddenly knew what course of action I
   needed to take in order to get back to that feeling of oneness with the
   world in front of me. It was powerful, and I’m still buzzing with the
   sense of relief.

   When you work for yourself (or anyone really), it seems easy to get
   caught up in a lot of “What if” lines of questioning. What if it
   doesn’t work out? What if people hate me for doing this? What if a
   recipe doesn’t get X amount of likes on Instagram? What if this
   decision changes my work and career completely? What if this isn’t
   sustainable? Focusing on these queries really screwed me over in terms
   of productivity and overall happiness last week. Letting go of the
   puzzle pieces that didn’t fit was a lot easier to do once I started
   asking “Why?” instead.

   Over five years ago, I had a job interview for a server position in a
   fine dining restaurant. The owner/proprietor didn’t care about how much
   experience I had or what restaurants I had worked in before. She wanted
   to know how passionate I was about hospitality and making connections
   with people, adding that if you love doing anything enough, some
   measure of prosperity will always follow. I didn’t last at that job
   (dropped a whole tray of fluted up champagne at someone’s wedding on
   the first day uuuuugh), but her message stuck with me for a while
   because it focused on the Why. Sometimes when I get off track and start
   thinking about my decisions solely as a means to an end, I try to
   bring myself back to that conversation.

   On the day that I had those moments of clarity and relief, I made these
   tacos. The two events were most likely unrelated, but maybe just
   slightly linked in the cosmos? I had been thinking about doing a taco
   or something with king oyster mushrooms, but it felt a little
   predictable pre-superbowl. Then I went to the store, bought the
   mushrooms and tortillas, a doughnut for good measure, and now here we
   are. These vegan tacos are deceptively, weirdly meaty. I only say weird
   because I don’t typically chase after that unctuous texture with
   plant-based foods because it freaks me out a bit. The mild sweetness
   and soft, lightly chewy texture of king oyster mushrooms is a trip.
   Maybe I’m just really disconnected from animal protein, but I second
   guess myself when I eat these mushrooms. I douse them in a deep, smoky,
   and rich sauce that has spice, light sweetness, acidity, heft, and a
   sprinkle of cacao powder too. It’s complex and hard to stop eating. I
   know the ingredient list looks long, but most of it is pantry stuff
   (minus the dates and chipotle powder–but these can be had in small
   quantities in bulk shops). Let there be sauce, go team etc! ;)

   ROASTED KING OYSTER MUSHROOM TACOS W/ CHIPOTLE CACAO SAUCE RECIPE
   [52]Print the recipe here!
   Serves: Makes enough for 8-10 tacos with extra sauce
   Notes: When I had my sauce all finished, I stirred in a tiny drizzle of
   maple syrup because I thought it needed a little extra balance. I
   realize that some people are really sensitive to sweetness, and I
   figured that the inclusion of dates might already be reason enough to
   deter some people here. Just mentioning this maple addition here
   because I didn’t include it in the ingredients–season this however you
   need to :)

   CACAO CHIPOTLE SAUCE INGREDIENTS:
   1/4 cup sunflower or grapeseed oil
   1 medium cooking onion, diced (about 1 cup diced onion)
   4 cloves of garlic, chopped
   1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
   2 teaspoons dried chipotle chili powder
   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
   1/8 tsp ground cloves
   1 tablespoon sesame seeds
   1/4 cup tomato paste
   2 Medjool dates, pitted and chopped
   1 tablespoon almond butter (I prefer roasted here)
   1 cup hot water
   2 tablespoons cacao or unsweetened cocoa powder
   1/2 teaspoon gluten-free tamari or coconut aminos

   FOR THE TACOS:
   1 lb king oyster mushrooms, sliced
   1 tablespoon sunflower or grapeseed oil
   sea salt and ground black pepper, to taste
   8-10 6-inch tortillas, warmed
   1 ripe avocado, peeled and sliced
   3-4 radishes, sliced thin
   fresh cilantro leaves

   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

   Make the sauce: Heat the sunflower oil in a medium saucepan over medium
   heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until quite soft,
   about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, oregano, chipotle chili powder,
   cinnamon, cloves, and sesame seeds. Keep stirring and cooking until all
   spices are fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and stir for
   another minute or so, just to get some of the raw-ness out of the
   paste. Take the onion mixture off the heat and carefully transfer it to
   an upright blender.

   To the onion mixture, add the chopped dates, almond butter, and hot
   water. Blitz this mixture on high until you have a smooth puree. Return
   the mixture to the saucepan, add the cacao powder and the tamari and
   stir to combine. Simmer the sauce for 10 minutes, stirring constantly.
   The sauce should be quite thick and glossy. Keep the sauce warm or at
   room temperature while you prepare the taco components.

   Place the sliced king oyster mushrooms in a 9 x 13 baking dish (with at
   least 2-inch high sides). Toss the mushrooms with the sunflower oil,
   salt, and pepper. Cover the dish tightly with foil and place in the
   oven. Roast mushrooms for 20 minutes. After the 20 minute mark, remove
   the mushrooms from the oven and carefully take the foil off the top.
   Toss the mushrooms a bit and return the dish to the oven, uncovered,
   for another 10 minutes. The mushrooms should be soft and most of the
   juice should be dried up at this point. Keep them warm while you
   assemble the tacos.

   For one taco, lay a warmed tortilla on a plate. Put a good spoonful of
   the roasted mushrooms down the center. Top the mushrooms with 1-2
   tablespoons of the chipotle cacao sauce. Then, finish the taco with
   avocado slices, radishes, and cilantro. Repeat this process with the
   remaining ingredients. Serve warm.

       I am pretty stoked about the fact that I have every ingredient

       up. I’m craving tacos lately and these look delicious! Also aren’t
       those convos that stick with you so good? If I were a “hang quotes
       on your wall” kind of person, those would be the ones to make it
       up. I hope it’s all sorting out for you Laura! :) ps I found blood

       I have to admit, I love this recipe spree you are on- a bit selfish
       of me since I know how much work goes into it but I can’t help
       feeling excited when I see your posts in my inbox. Not just for the
       recipes, but for the writing as well.
       Tacos are boss- despite my man telling that they are just
       sandwiches that are harder to eat, we have them regularly. Again,
       selfish because I love them so and more than willing to eat any
       with chipotle in it.
       Thanks for the reminder and permission to turn off the noise.

       Hang in there, lady! I feel like if you weren’t asking yourself
       these questions, you would lack the feeling of being challenged.
       And I know you’re not one to sit back + take the easy way. A little
       bit of unknown in the day-to-day keeps us from becoming complacent.
       And you’re basically KILLING IT. And also, those chubby mushrooms.
       Major hearts. Okay…1 more thing. My therapist used to have me play
       out the “what ifs” out loud or on paper. So basically say/list all
       of the things that would result if XYZ actually happened. I cannot
       tell you how much that helped. Mostly, I was snowballing everything
       in my head and letting anxiety take over. But I realized if the
       “what ifs” actually played out, it was nothing I couldn’t handle.

            I think a square of bittersweet/super dark chocolate would be
            excellent. I only tested with the cacao/cocoa powder because I
            figured most people would have it in their pantry. Let me know

       Man oh man do I feel you on the spiraling thought patterns! It’s
       hard to pull yourself out of, especially when working for
       yourself––you “control” so many parts of your business
       ventures/day-to-day life. Cooking has always been a way for me to
       relinquish some of that control and ask some of those same
       questions. Do I love this? Am I connected to this? Is this where I
       find passion and fulfillment? The answer is always yes, but it
       takes stepping back to see the *why* and move forward with that in
       mind. Much love, Laura! Aaaaand these tacos look bomb AF. Your
       photos are stunning, such a mid-week treat to pour through. I can’t
       wait to make these, and slow down just a bit :-)[117]ReplyCancel

            I think creative people of all stripes get into the spiral of
            doom from time to time. It’s good to be self-reflective and
            believe that you can aim higher for yourself by
            controlling/optimizing every aspect, but it’s crazy-making
            too. Chilling out vis a vis cooking is probably one of the
            better ways to cope :)

       {three!!!} of my Facebook applications from my phone. Thank you for
       inspiring me to do that, I instantaneously felt a sense of relief.
       A lightness. Less clutter up there. I admire your work, and
       commitment to be the very best version of yourself Laura. I trust
       the universe has your back. All my love always,
       xx!![140]ReplyCancel

            Yes! Relief is release and I’m all smiles to help with that,
            in whatever tiny way. Love and hugs to you, miss.

       This was such a great reminder to “tune in” with myself. I try to
       put my faith in the universe and try not to overthink the “signs”,
       but sometimes it is really hard. So, thank you![144]ReplyCancel

       I made these tacos last night. They were delicious! Loved the sauce
       ….found it more than sweet enough with the dates.

       I’m so thankful for your honesty here, Laura. Working for yourself,
       especially in this business, is a tough balance at times and one
       I’m struggling to figure out as well. It looks as if glancing
       through these comments there are quite a few of us all feeling the
       same! We need a virtual blogger support group to vent/speak wisdom
       into or something. Now going onto my phone to delete some apps ;)
       thank you for the little push I (and so many others) needed to
       clear our headspace! And these tacos?! Swoon. I’ve never had this
       type of mushroom but now need to go hunting for some!

       Yes, yes, yes for more space in life and for clarity. Sometimes
       it’s so hard to focus on your own thing when there’s so much noise
       + pressure from social media..but I keep telling to myself this
       same mantra over and over again: “Do less with more focus”.
       Trusting your intuition and doing your own thing always pays out in
       the end, so keep it up Laura, you’re full of magic! And the tacos,
       yum. xx[151]ReplyCancel

       I had my first King Oyster Mushroom today in a vegan bowl of ramen
       – man they’re meaty! And mighty![153]ReplyCancel

       That’s so interesting. It’s so important for us all to understand
       the things that are holding us back, we live in a techno fuzz don’t
       we, it’s so draining, and our inner voice is all we should be
       listening to and developing. Go for it! xx[155]ReplyCancel
