   THERE IS A single line of purple seats at the Colorado Rockies’ Coors
   Field, indicating a height of 5,280 feet above sea level. Such
   reminders that you’re in the Mile High City are never far away in
   Denver, but this town has quietly risen above its reputation for thin
   air, bearded skiers and a mega-hub airport; it’s now equally known for
   world-class food along with insane vistas and other outdoor pursuits
   that don’t involve $160 lift tickets. My family has its little secret
   go-to spot in the Caribbean, but the kids wanted to try something new
   this winter, so we decided to give Denver a few days to win us over.

   Chloe, an amateur photographer, is a sophomore at NYU. Sam is a
   sports-loving high school pitcher, and Jonah, 12, had to be torn away
   from his computer to make the flight. My wife, Leslie, a super-healthy
   foodie, headed up planning.

   Denver isn’t really in the Rocky Mountains. It’s more of a base camp at
   their edge: the last flat spot to pitch your tent as you head west for
   gold. All of the visitor literature warns that you will get winded
   walking up stairs and tipsy on a single beer, but, given our mild,
   touristy level of physical exertion, all the thin air did was stoke our
   appetites, which was fine, because Leslie had a long list of
   restaurants she wanted to try.

   Every day, after breakfast, we’d wander. We climbed all over the Roman
   Empire-style Red Rocks Amphitheater, 10 miles west of town, where
   musicians have performed since the early 1900s (long before the U2
   concert video put it on the map).

   At Buffalo Bill’s Museum & Grave, we trotted past glass-encased guns
   and saddles and several giant, well-preserved posters for Bill’s
   traveling Wild West Show. But it was the gift shop, a Venus fly trap of
   kitsch, cluttered with bins of arrowheads and switchblade combs and
   other wallet-draining nonsense, that transported me back to car trips
   with my own parents. My kids only had eyes for the homemade fudge.

   Having paid tribute to the hunter, we turned our attention to the
   hunted. At the Buffalo Herd Nature Reserve, we slipped and slid in the
   mud just like the Plains Indians of old and watched the majestic bovids
   snort and puff on the other side of a chain-link fence.

   I was determined to try fly-fishing for the first time, so Leslie set
   up a private outing for just the boys and me (fewer fishermen; more
   fish to go around). Our guide met us at a river an hour southwest of
   Denver, where we suited up in waders and strode into the icy water,
   feverishly clutching pocket hand warmers.

   We cast our lures and let them trail toward the hungry trout we hoped
   were there. Before long, my sportsman son, Sam, caught a fat, 24-inch
   rainbow, whereupon young Jonah fell into the river. He spent the rest
   of the outing shivering gloomily in the truck.

   While the boys and I were beguiling fish, Leslie and Chloe carved out
   some mother-daughter time snooping around the artsy, historic LoDo
   district and shopping for boots in the Cherry Creek neighborhood, rife
   with luxury shops.

   Later, we traded tales at the Buckhorn Exchange, a
   steakhouse-cum-taxidermy vault that proved more amusing than
   appetizing. Each of its walls is covered with hundreds of furry heads
   of moose, caribou and other creatures—even a 10-foot Kodiak bear glares
   at you. But the overpriced food—fried alligator tail, elk—disappointed.
   Go to gawk but not to eat.

   On another day, Sam and I went to the University of Colorado campus in
   nearby Boulder to see Stanford’s football team ride herd all over the
   sorry Buffaloes. Afterward, we caught up with Leslie, Chloe and Jonah
   at Boulder’s Pearl Street Mall, a pedestrian zone buzzing with street
   buskers, students and tourists. When my boys and I started kicking
   around a hackysack we’d bought on impulse, it wasn’t long before some
   more-accomplished locals joined in.

   Our last taste of Colorado was a sundown hike along the Red Rocks Trail
   at Boulder’s Settlers’ Park, a short but steep climb to ridgeline
   sunset views. Chloe shot some great panoramas with her phone as the
   boys crawled all over the red boulders thrusting up through the earth.
   I had to pull them off like ticks to beat the sinking sun back to the
   car.

The Lowdown // Eating and Touring Around Denver

   Getting There: Denver is a major hub served by carriers including
   American, United, Delta, JetBlue and Southwest.

   ENLARGE

   Staying There: A Denver institution since 1892, the central Brown
   Palace has newly renovated, comfortable rooms (from about $230 a night;
   [356]brownpalace.com). The new Crawford, set in Denver’s landmark Union
   Station, has several room categories (including one inspired by sleeper
   compartments on luxury trains) and is surrounded by good restaurants
   and shops (from about $220 a night; [357]thecrawfordhotel.com).

   Eating There: For breakfast try Snooze, where Donut Pancakes come with
   frosting, sprinkles and holes ([358]snoozeeatery.com). Root Down serves
   up excellent organic grub such as sliders and short ribs with Brussels
   sprouts ( [359]rootdowndenver.com). Boulder’s Early Bird Restaurant
   dishes up crème brûlée French toast with dark chocolate and bacon
   ([360]earlybirdrestaurant.com). Golden’s tiny terror D’Deli concocts
   delicious, dizzyingly complex sandwiches like the Jolly Olly: barbecue
   pork, bacon, cream cheese, raspberry chipotle, crispy fried onions and
   more ([361]ddeligolden.com).

   Touring There: The Red Rocks Amphitheater, on the western edge of
   Denver, is well worth the hike up ( [362]redrocksonline.com). Close by,
   check out Buffalo Bill’s Museum & Grave ([363]buffalobill.org). Set
   your fly fishing up with Mile High Angler ([364]trouttrips.com).

   You missed Beau Joes Pizza in Idaho Springs!

   The suggestions and destinations in this poorly written article are
   terribly dated and cliche. Did this author read a guide book and write
   this article without even visiting Denver? Why do people insist on
   maintaining that Denver is the wild west? Denver has evolved and travel
   writers should honestly assess the city. This is 2016--Denver has a
   fantastic food and arts scene. There are miles and miles of bicycle
   paths through scenic city, suburban and rural scenery. The craft
   brewery and spirits industries are flourishing. LoDo, RiNo and LoHi are
   teaming with restaurants, galleries, bars, and entertainment venues.
   There is culture and opportunity everywhere.

   Red Rocks is breath taking but the rest of this article was designed to
   underwhelm.

   And for all of the people commenting about the marijuana issue--it is
   niche and unless you go looking, it isn't really that obvious. It isn't
   a big deal.

   As another poster mentioned, avoid the State Capitol park and 16th
   Street Mall--sketchy.

   Of course, marijuana vacations to Colorado are all the rage. Leave the
   kids with Grandma and go get high in the Mile High city.
   Gregory Craig
   Gregory Craig subscriber 5pts

   Other places to check out:

   Highlands area, beautiful view of city, great restaurants including
   Avanti, Lola and many others

   LoDo restaurants: ChoLon, The Kitchen, Rioja on Larimer Sq.

   Other restaurants; Vine Street Pub in Denver, good prices, great vibe;
   also same restaurant group in Boulder- Mountain Sun or Southern Sun,
   Jax in Boulder or Denver

   Things to do: grab a bike from city rental bike fleet, ride Cherry
   Creek bike trail downtown, even in winter; REI flagship store next to
   Platte River is a must do for any outdoor enthusiast, Starbucks there
   great for people watching; hang out in Union Station lobby playing
   tabletop shuffleboard while waiting for 45 minutes for your Snooze
   table

   Bars: Union Lodge No. 1 on Champa, Williams and Graham in Highlands,
   Green Russell on Larimer Sq,

   The pot thing really is a non-issue unless you're a tightly wound
   moralist. Denver does have a serious homeless issue but rarely
   threatening. City also seems to have decided that area along Cherry
   Creek behind convention center is the officially designated open heroin
   market but they won't bother you.

   Early Bird Restaurant is in Westminster, which according to the last
   map I gazed - and its website - is not Boulder
   Andrew Nygard

   Leave Denver and drive up to Estes Park - the Rocky Mountain National
   Forest is there.  You can rent snowshoes and boots at any one of a
   number of places in town ($30 for two people for a day)  and 45 minutes
   later you can be trekking through fresh powder at 10,000 feet in an
   alpine forest.  Try Bear Lake and the paths around (Table Top,
   Bierstadt Lake and Emerald Lake make good destinations)  No skis
   required.
   Pro Tip:  The Park opens at 7AM, and the snowplows start right there
   after - hit the park gate at 7AM (no one to collect the daily fee at
   that point) and follow the plow up to the Bear Lake parking lot,
   You'll beat the crowd (after 10AM there may be no parking) and enjoy
   some much needed solitude as you bushwhack the trail for the day.

   [376]@Andrew Burish I have lived 8 years in Atlanta, and have lived 4
   years (so far) in Denver. If you didn't know any better and you sniffed
   the air in both downtowns, you would assume weed was legal in ATL.

   It's really not that big a deal here.
   Fred Smith
   Fred Smith subscriber 5pts

   [377]@Andrew Burish do you live there?  If you don't smoke pot and
   don't frequent the pot shops and don't go out of your way to look for
   it, you might never know that pot is legalized in CO.
   David Brown
   David Brown subscriber 5pts

   [378]@Fred Smith [379]@Andrew Burish  Way too many young drivers are
   stoned. And way too many pot shop owners are gangsters. I live in
   Denver I know.

   Just don't visit the Denver 16th St Mall. It is filled with drunken
   bums and drug dealing addicts. Rather an amazing slum that the Mayor
   and other city politicos seem to enjoy/ignore. Also avoid the State
   Capitol, grand building that it is, unless you want to buy drugs, as
   they are available 24/7 around the building. The good members of the
   legislature hear and see no evil.

   Denver is a boring flatland city.  If you are going to visit Colorado,
   go to Colorado Springs.

   OK, it doesn't have the night life the Denver has, but the outdoor
   activities are far superior.

   Earlier this year I received an apology letter from WSJ because they
   increased the monthly subscription rate without alerting me that a
   price increase was coming.   Hmmm, just wondering if I'll get another
   letter apologizing for them publishing this vanilla flavored travel
   article.  Editors are supposed to cull out this kind of article.  Not
   exactly a Rocky Mountain High for me.
   RICHARD BERRY
   RICHARD BERRY subscriber 5pts

   [380]@DAVID FRECH

   I truly enjoy Denver and the Rockies.  I am a serious fly fisherman.
   When I saw the headline I was looking forward to reading the article.
   Disappointing, unless looking for a taxidermy display.
