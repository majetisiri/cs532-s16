   Remember when you were a kid and Christmas day was all you could think
   about? I would count down the days to the 25th and try so hard to stay
   up all night to get a glimpse of Santa. But of course I’d always fall
   asleep within minutes and I never had a chance to see him.

   But now that I’m a “grown-up,” I had no excitement for Christmas this
   year.

   That is, until this happened – major
   Christmas-present-unwrapping-chaos.

   And this.

   And I got even more excited when the antlers came out.

   Sherman also seemed to love our present – is it wrong that I want my
   niece to be a food blogger just like me? At least she gets to do it
   with a super cool apron.

   And of course here’s Chandler – I love his cute little face as he
   watches his parents help open his presents.

   But now that Christmas is over, I guess it’s time to bring out the big
   guns and start some major clean eating. But I’m sure you’ll think I’m
   completely hypocritical when you see tomorrow’s post – hey, at least
   I’m trying, right?

   So here you have it – a white bean dip with a Mexican twist and some
   chipotle peppers for a spicy kick. You can easily serve it as a dip for
   your New Year’s party since it takes just 5 minutes to make or you can
   eat it as a midnight snack guilt-free!

       How did I miss this post last week? This looks fantastic! I love
       the spiciness that you’ve added to the white beans in this dip!

       Wow! This is good and really spicy even with one can of peppers. My
       husband will love this!

       This is amazing! I pinned it awhile back and finally made it. My
       husband said, “This is excellent. And you know I don’t hand out
       ‘excellents’ easily.” Haha! Thank you! This is now a staple in our
       house.

       This is excellent. I did not change a thing and will not. Thank
       you. You have some great recipes. Coffee cake muffins! Thanks
       again.

       Finally made this last night and it is damn delicious as you say!
       It’s a nice change from the usual chick pea hummus. I added some
       tahini because I like the richness it gives a bean dip (and also
       because I happened to have it and it is damn expensive so I better
       use it!). Eating it as we speak and have been putting it on
       everything! Thanks for the great recipe!

       White beans are so perfect for dips!! This looks fantastic! Can’t
       wait to make!

       This was really easy and quick to make! Nice flavors too. However,
       it leaves a super strong taste in your mouth afterwards. But it was
       delicious and went great with pita chips and tortilla chips as
       suggested.

       Very good even though I used an olive oil that was not suited for
       this.  Next time I will use a mild flavored olive oil. We ate this
       with tortilla chips
   11. Jess — [58]January 4, 2016 @ 1:25 PM [59]Reply
       Thank you! This turned a lone can of white beans into tasty. Very
       good.
