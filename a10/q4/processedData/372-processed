15 Bucket-List Tacos in America

   From fried chicken-neck tacos in Boyle Heights, to the Tex-Mex alchemy
   of puffy tacos in San Antonio, we give you a roadmap for kicking off
   your eternal taco quest.
   [17]Justin Bolois Feb 4, 2016
   [o4ptrvhylovqtki8fpjx.jpg]

   In the season finale of the Netflix series Master of None, Aziz
   Ansari’s character, Dev, is faced with two major dilemmas—first, how to
   salvage his relationship with his girlfriend, and second, where to find
   the best tacos in New York City. His frenetic, multi-tab Google spree
   is not only a reminder of our [18]current priorities, but also
   our[19] obsessive—if not at times, rocky—relationship with tacos here
   in America.

   “Mexicans have been putting stuff in a tortilla, pinching it, and then
   eating it for thousands of years,” says Gustavo Arellano, author of
   [20]Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America. But the taco
   [21]didn’t formally seep into the American consciousness until after
   WWII, when veterans looking for opportunities to make money coincided
   with the rise of restaurant chains. That’s the scene Glen Bell, of Taco
   Bell fame, entered in San Bernadino, CA, deciding he’d focus on a
   hardshell-and-ground-beef combo after watching the McDonald’s brothers’
   financial success soar from their hamburger operation.

   “Glen would sit in the parking lot and seethe,” says Arellano. “He was
   very jealous.”

     “My hat is always off to the pioneers. It’s easy to hate on [places
     like] Taco Bell, but they whetted the palate for americans to try
     new food.”

   The 1950s also introduced the DIY taco kit, courtesy of George Ashley
   from El Paso, TX, who is credited as the inventor of tortillas in a can
   (#staywoke). The kit included a metal taco shell scaffold along with
   an instructional pamphlet, making it easy for housewives across the
   country to whip them up for Sunday supper.

   “My hat is always off to the pioneers,” says Arellano. “It’s easy to
   hate on [places like] Taco Bell, but they whetted the palate for
   Americans to try new food.”

   As the taco became a part of the American vernacular, Glen Bell’s chain
   spawned derivatives like Del Taco, and eventually fast-casual
   operations like El Torito, [22]setting the stage for the second phase
   of its cycle: the soft taco. “Technically that’s what it is, but no one
   calls it that,” says Arellano. Their emergence in the ’70s can largely
   be attributed to legendary SoCal chain, King Taco, which “basically
   created the taco truck as we know it,” says Arellano. “No one believed
   people would eat them from the truck format, but the King Taco
   founder knew something others didn’t. From there, everyone started
   copying him.”

   [23]This opened the floodgates for pioneers like Roy Choi, who
   [24]helped popularize the multicultural taco and bring Kogi to the
   mainstream. “Now we’re in the era of Chicano chefs like Wes Avila who
   have the culinary training to create artisanal tacos,” says Arellano.
   As the Chipotle E. coli scandal continues to compromise the burrito’s
   seemingly untouchable status in America—”it’s the Altamont of burrito
   culture,” says Arellano, equating it to the violent 1969 Northern
   California concert that ended the blissed-out hippie era—the void is
   wide open for the taco to inch its way up the ladder. “The taco is
   getting its proper respect right now,” says Arellano.

   To celebrate this moment in time, we’ve tapped a handful of authors,
   writers, taco bloggers, and even a couple of globe-trotting deejays to
   provide some intel on the scope of tacos here in the U.S. (And, yes,
   pardon the heavy West Coast coverage; it is, after all, the spiritual
   home of domestic tacos in many respects.)

Suadero Taco at El Paisa@.com

   SUADERO
   Address and phone: 4610 International Blvd, Oakland, CA
   Website: N/A

   birdsall Birdsall says: “The thing about food in a place like Oakland’s
   Fruitvale, where families with roots in Mexico have settled for more
   than a generation, is that it’s reflected pueblo culture, mostly: life
   in the small towns and ranchos of Jalisco or Michoacán, where the
   birrias and menudos suggest the quietness—sometimes the diffidence—of
   pastoral home life. El Paisa@.com, with a fake-web name that gestures
   at contemporary life, is an urban shitshow in the best way possible. No
   other place I know in Oakland has El Paisa’s surge and flow, the hustle
   of taquerías in Mexico City. At midday you file through the aisle-thin
   space of this long-ago burger stand, tell the lady who doesn’t have
   patience for your bullshit how many tacos you want, pay, and then inch
   to the taqueros, chopping meat on boards through windows like ravaged
   DMV counters. The cabeza—beef cheeks, primarily—is sweet in that
   concentration-of-protein way, and the lengua’s good, but what you
   really want is suadero, that muscle from the belly region of the cow—an
   emblematic cut at street taquerias in DF—which isn’t so much tender as
   it is smoothly grained and pale, like organ meat. El Paisa’s tacos
   express the perfectibility of food on a small scale, in a culture that
   respects it. But hey, this is East Oakland! You’ll hunch at a table
   along with queer Latinas with facial piercing jewelry and big Asian
   guys who look like club bouncers. The Fruitvale families smart enough
   to grab the good seats before they got in line: They’re just focused on
   the tacos.” (Photo courtesy John Birdsall)

Carnitas Taco at Carnitas Uruapan

   carnitas
   Address and phone: 1725 W 18th St, Chicago, IL (312-226-2654)
   Website: [40]carnitasuruapanchi.com

   reganhofmann Hofmann says: “There is no mystery to what Carnitas
   Uruapan is all about. You walk in under a pig-adorned awning to a
   small, cafeteria-style dining room teeming with pigs: cartoon pigs,
   carved wooden pigs, ceramic pig figurines. There is only one thing to
   order, and of course it is pig—carnitas, pork that’s flash-fried then
   braised in more fat until it’s reduced to gleaming, shuddering hunks of
   meat, ready to fall apart at the touch of a knife. Order at the
   counter, where slabs of lean meat, rib, belly, stomach (buche), and
   skin are rough-chopped in whatever mix-and-match combination you like
   (get a little bit of everything for a textural thrill), piled onto
   obscenely fresh, corn-perfumed tortillas, or weighed out by the pound.
   Maybe add a chunk of one of the great sheets of chicharron that sit in
   the window—you know, for a snack—but don’t look for superfluous onions
   or cilantro; there’s salsa and pickled jalapenos, but they’re just a
   distraction. The inspirational mottos on the wall and cartoon-adorned
   menus may not look the part, but the 40-year-old Carnitas Uruapan may
   be the closest thing we have to the dining temples of Japan, where
   dedicated practitioners of kitchen zen spend lifetimes making the same
   dish, the unattainable pursuit of perfection their only goal.” (Photo:

Brisket Taco at Valentina’s Tex Mex BBQ

   briskettacos

   Address and phone: 7612 Brodie Ln, Austin, TX (512-221-4248)
   Website: [42]valentinastexmexbbq.com

   mando Rayo says: There are two food groups in Texas: Barbecue and
   Tacos, and you can get the best of both worlds when you eat at
   Valentina’s Tex Mex BBQ. In Central Texas, we have plenty of choices
   for slow-cooked meats, but none push the envelope like Miguel Vidal’s
   San Antonio and Austin mash-up cuisine. Although he operates out of
   Austin, Vidal is a San Antonio native with strong ties to its culinary
   traditions. On weekends, his father would smoke and grill las carnes
   while his mom and tias would make fresh tortillas, salsas, guacamole,
   rice, and beans. That’s what makes Valentina’s tacos so special—it’s a
   mix and true representation of Tejas. The Smoked Brisket Taco is
   probably one of the best tacos in the Lonestar state—smoked brisket on
   mesquite with guacamole, sea salt, and serrano salsa on a freshly
   pressed flour tortilla. If you cruise by at 2am or 2pm, you’ll see
   Miguel and his team cooking up some of the best barbecue and tacos in
   Texas. Now that’s what I call a one-two punch.” (Photo courtesy Armando

Poke Poi Taco at Surf N Turf Tacos

   poi
   Address and phone: 2310 Kuhio Ave, Honolulu, HI (808-922-8226)
   Website: N/A

   dekneef Dekneef says: “One of my favorite things about eating in Hawaii
   is how a typical meal can incorporate five cultures on a single plate,
   and nobody bats an eyelash. Unsurprisingly, a taco exists in Waikiki
   that reflects this: the ahi poke tacos on a poi tortilla at Surf N Turf
   Tacos. Thick slices of fresh tuna are drenched in a smoky chipotle
   sauce and sit atop a chewy purple taro vessel. Taro, or kalo in
   Hawaiian, is a root vegetable, one of the few plants the earliest
   Hawaiian settlers brought over in their canoes and cultivated as a
   staple. Among locals, Hawaii is notorious for its limited selection of
   Mexican food (what we’d call one of those special #hawaiiproblems), and
   of the handful that are open for business, the topic of authenticity
   always gets dragged into the conversation. Now that I’m back in Hawaii
   after having spent four years living in L.A., I’m not necessarily
   interested in looking for something that attempts to fit in with what
   you could find in the holy land of 2am taco trucks. Instead, what I get
   is a taco completely unique to the region, that can be walked to after
   an afternoon at the beach—and that’s ‘real’ enough for me.” (Photo:

Puffy Taco at Ray’s Drive Inn

   puffy
   Address and phone: 822 SW 19th St, San Antonio, TX (210-432-7171)
   Website: [44]raysdriveinn.net

   jose Ralat says: “There is no greater regional Texas taco than the San
   Antonio puffy taco. Little known outside of the Lone Star State, the
   puffy taco is made from raw corn masa formed into a U-shape during
   deep-frying. If cooked perfectly, the shell’s exterior will be light
   and snappy, with some flaking; the shell’s interior will be chewy but
   not tough. None of it will be greasy. In that sense, it is a marvel of
   Tex-Mex alchemy. My favorite is filled with the classic spiced ground
   beef mixture known as picadillo, topped with the Tex-Mex trinity of
   lettuce, tomato and cheese, served at Ray’s Drive Inn in San
   Antonio. Ray’s (which even holds the trademark for the name) is where
   the puffy taco was standardized after opening in 1956, and where
   brother Henry learned the craft before opening his own place. Arturo,
   another brother, started his own namesake restaurant in Whittier,
   California, and eventually came to run Ray’s as well. Arturo himself
   died last year, but the Lopez legacy lives on. I know one thing: when
   the end is near, I want my last taco to be from Ray’s.” (Photo:

Tacos Arabes at Ricos Tacos

   tacoarabes
   Address and phone: 505 51st St, Brooklyn, NY (718-633-4816)
   Website: N/A

   jordana Rothman says: “If someone ever wrote a song about me, it would
   be a mariachi ballad about a strange blonde gringa, a remorseless
   taco-eating machine, who stalks the Mexican cafes of Sunset Park,
   Brooklyn. It would be called, ‘Is She Going to Eat All Of That
   Herself?’ and the chorus would be, ‘sí, obviously, now look away.’
   Anyhow, all of this is to say that I have a certain level of comfort
   with the taquerías of deep Brooklyn, and each spot has its own quirks
   and merits. But the tacos Arabes at Ricos Tacos are the real death-row
   order. The pork is cooked al pastor—on a vertical spit that rotates in
   front of a gas flame—so the shaved meat has a great char-to-moist
   ratio. The al pastor method itself evolved from the traditions of
   Mexico’s Lebanese immigrant population (you get one guess at the
   translation of “Arabes”). This style of taco is often served on a corn
   tortilla, as at Alex Stupak’s Empellón Al Pastor, but the gang at Ricos
   goes a step further to honor the dish’s Middle Eastern lineage: The
   tacos Arabes are served rolled up in a blistered, pita-like flatbread
   that is the perfect stretchy and supple cradle for the spicy, crispy
   meat.” (Photos: Doron Gild, [46]Yelp/Kenny C.)

Guisado Taco at Guisado’s

   guisados
   Address and phone: 1261 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA (213-250-7600)
   Website: [47]guisados.co

   marx Marx says: “Going to a taquería and falling in love with a
   tortilla is a little like getting a present and falling in love with
   the box, but such is the greatness of the tortillas that one finds at
   Guisado’s. Fresh, thick, fluffy, and expertly griddled, they’re so
   sublime that I could easily eat a stack of them on their own, with no
   adornment save for perhaps a knob of butter. Having said all that, the
   rest of Guisados’ tacos are pretty amazing, too. Though they specialize
   in stewed meats—the cochinita pibil is legendary—I’m partial to their
   fish tacos, which come grilled instead of battered and fried, and the
   hongos, or mushrooms, which come with a generous scattering of
   cilantro. The first time I went to the Guisado’s on Sunset Blvd there
   was a line, which made me grumpy, but really, once you sit down on the
   back patio and are presented with a plastic tray covered in hot tacos,
   there is absolutely no way to stay that way—it’s like watching the sun
   cast its rays on a field of unicorns and puppies.” (Photo: Erin

Ground Beef Taco at Jimboy’s Tacos

   jimboys
   Address and phone: 1420 29th St, Sacramento, CA (916-452-6451)
   Website: [48]jimboystacos.com

   cova Cova says: “There’s a lot to be said for boundary-pushing,
   thought-provoking tacos. It seems nowadays every chef has some take on
   them. However, in light of this Instagram-ready era of food, I submit
   to you the regional delicacy of Jimboy’s Tacos, a fast-food
   taco-slinging institution that’s been around for 60 years. These tacos
   are ugly and unapologetically inauthentic. The classic Jimboy’s taco is
   simply a fried corn tortilla that’s coated with a generic Parmesan
   cheese on the outside, and filled with a dirty seasoned ground beef
   layer, topped with shredded cheddar cheese and lettuce.

   In fact, I propose the reason this chain has never really spread much
   farther than Sacramento and Reno is because of its rough appearance,
   silly name that doesn’t have the word taqueria, and use of brown
   tables, which sound the alarms for most people not-in-the-know. But, in
   my mind, this may be the most American taco we have. As their website
   boasts, “By blending subtle flavors from several cultures and applying
   them in a marketable way, Jim introduced a taco that explodes with
   character and stands apart from any other taco on the market.” Even if
   it’s untraditional in a Steve Buscemi way, it’s truly a bucket-list
   taco.” (Photo: Facebook/Jimboys)

Suadero Taco at Taqueria Izucar

   suadero
   Address and phone: 1503 Myrtle Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11237 (718-456-0569)
   Website: N/A

   scarlett Lindeman says: “Start with an order of three tacos de suadero,
   con todo, at Taqueria Izucar in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Handed over on a
   paper plate, the tight, tiny tacos of braised beef release rivulets of
   braising juice and liquefied fat to gild the delivery to your mouth.
   Suadero is usually from the naval beef plate, marinated with a splash
   of vinegar, marjoram, and salt, so the clean and irony-smack of beef
   comes through; texture is derived from being briefly frizzled on the
   flattop. There are radish coins, pyramids of lime, and finely tuned
   salsas along side. Just a dab of salsa—the red stitched with dry heat
   and the green, a tart counterpoint. Sometimes, if you catch them on the
   right day, there’s tepache, the lightly fermented pineapple drink
   that’s a perfect foil for the tacos. Izucar is a panacea for bitter
   winters, when the snow has finally revealed the trash piles entombed
   underneath, and the JMZ rumbles overhead. There’s no where you could
   be, but eating Mexican in New York.” (Photo: [49]Yelp/Brendan T.)

Pescuezo Taco at Santa Rita Jalisco

   chickenneck
   Address and phone: 3900 E 1st St, Los Angeles, CA (323-261-2738)
   Website: N/A

   gabriel Carbajal says: “While L.A. has a plethora of loncheras and
   stands offering customary nighttime options like carne asada, al
   pastor, and carnitas tacos, there is only one place slinging deep-fried
   pescuezo (chicken neck) tacos. Cue Santa Rita Jalisco, a Boyle Heights
   truck that specializes in tacos similar to the ones made at Kentucky
   Fried Buches—a hole-in-the-wall joint in Tijuana, Mexico, where fried
   chicken necks first became popular. Each four-to-six piece order comes
   topped with a generous amount of spicy tomato salsa, a side of
   cucumber, limes, and warm corn tortillas. Some chicken necks are are
   mostly crispy skin, while others are surprisingly meaty and are worth
   picking apart to be placed on a tortilla. Even though I’d never put
   myself above cheap tacos, I don’t always like to settle for
   flattop-grilled beef or pork that’s been reheated just before being
   plopped onto coaster-sized tortillas. That’s the draw of Santa Rita
   Jalisco—a unique, build-your-own taco kit that contains golden-fried
   chicken necks, warm tortillas and fresh, spicy tomato salsa.” (Photo

Fried Shrimp Taco at Mariscos Jalisco

   jalisco
   Address and phone: 3040 E Olympic Blvd, Los Angeles, CA (323-528-6701)
   Website: N/A

   lataco L.A. Taco says: “We often get emails or texts from out of town
   friends asking where to get good tacos (not surprising, since we’ve run
   L.A.’s original taco & art blog since 2005). Sometimes people will get
   specific—what’s the one taco I must have during my stay? And my answer
   is always the same: Mariscos Jalisco in Boyle Heights. The lonchera has
   a reputation for excellent tostadas and other seafood items, but the
   indisputable star is the taco dorado de camaron. That is, a golden
   brown, fried corn tortilla lovingly wrapped around lightly-breaded
   fried shrimp, covered in avocado slices and a thin tomato- and
   cabbage-based salsa. The extremely crunchy shell gives way to
   delicately tender shrimp, while the tomato salsa runs into every nook
   and cranny.

   The chef/owner of the truck, Raul, is extremely guarded about the exact
   recipe. Back in 2010, when we launched the first Taco Madness event, we
   invited a bunch of our favorite taqueros to our friend Bricia Lopez’s
   iconic Oaxacan restaurant, Guelaguetza, for a cook-off. Raul declined,
   stating that there was no way he’d ever cook his tacos in open view of
   the other chefs, as they were sure to spy on him and steal his recipe.
   He actually had reason to be paranoid—once at an event, a very
   inebriated dude came up to L.A. food blogger Bill Esparza and confessed
   that he and his brother had been stalking the Mariscos Jalisco truck,
   peeking into the windows and reverse-engineering the tacos to open up
   their own location. While you can get a similar taco at a few other
   spots in L.A., none of them holds a candle to Raul’s creation. Whatever
   his secret is, it works.” (Photo courtesy Gabriel Carbajal)

Barbacoa Taco at El Milagrito

   Address and phone: 521 E. Woodlawn Ave, San Antonio TX (210-737-8646)
   Website: [50]elmilagritocafe.com

   edmund Tijerina says: “In San Antonio, barbacoa is almost a religion,
   and the congregation comes together every weekend, when people stand in
   line at tortilla factories all over the city to buy the shredded meat
   from steamed beef heads or cheeks. The tender, simply seasoned beef is
   a South Texas tradition with roots in the ancient, indigenous method of
   pit cooking, and any Sunday when I was a kid that included barbacoa was
   a special one. Most tortillerías serve their barbacoa only on Sundays,
   but when I’m craving it in the middle of the week, I visit El
   Milagrito, a place that steams beef cheeks every day. There’s nothing
   like El Milagrito’s fresh barbacoa in a hot tortilla—corn or flour is a
   mood thing—with a spoonful of the accompanying diced white onion and
   minced cilantro, along with drizzle a squeeze of salsa. The barbacoa is
   wonderful. The memories it evokes are even better.” (Photo courtesy

Carne Asada Taco at Taqueria Cancùn

   Address and phone: 3211 Mission St, San Francisco, CA, 94110
   (415-550-1414)
   Website: N/A

   atrak A-trak says: “People come to SF from all over in search of
   ‘Mission-style burritos,’ but in their obsessive hunt, they often
   overlook one of the best tacos in the neighborhood. The carne asada
   taco from Taqueria Cancun is by far the most flavorful (and hearty) you
   can get in the city, decked with generous avocado slices. Side note: go
   to the Cancùn on Mission and Fair Ave (in Bernal) to pick up the green
   salsa (better at this location) and take it with you to 19th street.

Special of the Day at Guerrilla Tacos

   uni Address and phone: Multiple (323-388-5340)
   Website: [51]guerrillatacos.com
   mosbaugh Mosbaugh says: “‘Uni on a tostada? What the…’ I thought to
   myself as Wes Avila reached down from the window of his blue Guerrilla
   truck and handed me a raw hamachi and sweet Santa Barbara sea-urchin
   tostada. Prior to my first Guerrilla Taco trip, I’d only experienced
   sushi-grade fish in taco/tostada form down in Baja, California. More
   specifically, I tried a snail-and-pesto taquito at Tacos Kokopelli in
   TJ, and a tostada topped with Pismo clams and sea urchin at La
   Guerrerense in Ensanada. My blissful [52]Baja seafood taco-eating binge
   seemed like a dream that couldn’t be relived once I drove back across
   the border—that is, until I had my first tostada from the Guerrilla
   truck. Since then, I’ve taken friends to get Guerrilla’s Ensanada-style
   fried shrimp tacos dressed with slaw, chile de arbol, and peanuts. I’ve
   driven way too fast down the 101 to get one of Avila’s foie gras and
   oxtail tacos before it sold out. The native Angeleno inside me knows
   this is Alta California cuisine at its peak; and no matter how you
   define it, there’s something so delightfully L.A. about eating uni in a
   tortilla.” (Photo: Erin Mosbaugh)

Octopus Taco at Tako



   [53]A photo posted by Pittsburgh City Paper (@pghcitypaper) on Jul 28,
   2015 at 11:38am PDT

   Address and phone: 214 6th St, Pittsburgh, PA (412-471-8256)
   Website: [54]takopgh.com

   djneil Click and drag to move Armstrong says: “Pittsburgh is one of
   those sleeper towns. Only the people who live there and have been there
   recently know how dope it is, and how great it’s becoming. Take, for
   instance, Tako, which has been around for less than a year and was
   opened by the same folks who run Meat & Potatoes and Butcher and the
   Rye. Taco spots are pretty standard fair up and down the West Coast and
   in your average foodsnob-central cosmopolitan destinations, but the
   team of Rick Deshantz, Tolga Devdik and Kevin Kelly brought something
   new to the Steel City, where once upon a time Jennifer Beals
   flash-danced to our delight. Tako is not your traditional Mexican
   taqueria; instead, these guys incorporate Asian influences, as the name
   of the restaurant suggests (tako is Japanese for octopus). The namesake
   taco is worth going for: grilled octopus, harissa aioli, preserved
   lemons, mizuna greens, and pickled red onion. Great presentation and
   taste, and they had Mobb Deep playing the last time I was there. 412
   speaks the dun language.” (Photo: Twitter
