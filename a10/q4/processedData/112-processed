   The burrito giant thinks it will bounce back within the first quarter
   of 2016.

   On Chipotle's latest earnings call, CEO Steve Ells acknowledged the
   belagured company had a long road ahead, but painted a positive picture
   for investors.

   Though Chipotle's 2015 fourth quarter earnings [25]were as depressing
   as expected, and though the burrito giant's January same store sales
   were down more than ever before — 36 percent year over year — the
   company believes its new systems (many of which are already in place)
   and robust marketing plan (at a cost of at least $50 million in the
   first quarter of 2016) will put it back on track to avoid continued
   losses by quarters two and three of 2016.

   This is all despite the company's internal research (divulged during
   the earnings call earlier today) that says 60 percent of Chipotle's
   most loyal, longtime customers — which can represent as much as 20
   percent of total sales — are avoiding or likely avoiding the chain
   right now, and that newer customers are grabbing lunch elsewhere too.

   Though the Denver-based chain is reporting low same store sales and
   lower than average foot traffic, it plans to "staff restaurants for a
   swift turnaround." But with less than a month's worth of practice on
   new food safety protocol and audits, how can the company be so
   confident customers will flock back for burritos and bowls?

   CFO John (Jack) Hartung is putting all of his faith in the new food
   safety systems (described below) and notes, in terms of "execution
   risk, a lot of the procedures are not happening in the restaurants...
   [and] the procedures are not hard to implement. It's a very clear step
   that will make each ingredient absolutely safe."
   Here's Chipotle's multi-pronged turnaround plan that it hopes will
   guide loyal customers back into its restaurants and attract new
   customers:
   1. New food safety protocol

   Chipotle executives said new protocols will put the company in a
   position to become "industry leaders in food safety." Among those
   protocols involve having staff prep and marinate proteins like steak
   and chicken after vegetable or other raw food prep happens.
   Additionally, Chipotle is having staff in its restaurant kitchens
   blanch (briefly submerge in boiling water and then cool) avocados,
   citrus, and onions before they are used.

   And perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Chipotle's food safety plan
   is the implementation of bar codes for each food item, allowing the
   company to trace ingredients — and therefore potential outbreaks of
   disease — back to the source immediately. Systems such as these require
   full cooperation between growers, purveyors, delivery personel, kitchen
   staff, and management. These systems also require a sort of checks and
   balances approach from staff in house and out, and could mean higher
   labor costs.
   2. Increased store audits by in-house management and third party
   inspectors
   Chipotle said it has stepped up internal audits, which internally now
   take place on a weekly basis. Independent restaurants across the U.S.
   already abide by these guidelines. The departments of health in LA,
   NYC, and other cities affected by Chipotle's recent outbreak require
   them. The company has also hired a third party auditor to inspect
   restaurants every quarter.
   3. A $50 million marketing and promotion campaign
   To be executed between marketing, promotion, and public relations
   efforts, Chipotle expects to spend at least $50 million in the first
   quarter of 2016 trying to win customers back. Public relations
   messaging and a new website devoted to food safety will focus on
   Chipotle's new food safety procedures, described above. Marketing (both
   direct marketing and social media marketing, including a new video-type
   game) will focus on value and quality with no mention of foodborne
   illness or safety. Chipotle's marketing team explained that the total
   spend could climb higher than $50 million if consumers redeem
   promotions. [26]Chipotle's upcoming Super Bowl promotion is the first
   test of this plan.
   4. Continued expansion
   Chipotle's real estate partners are still scouting new locations and
   plan to continue opening stores throughout the year. This gave at least
   one investor on the call pause. Executives, however, say they are
   confident a recovery will happen this year and have no plans to slow
   down.
   5. Aggressive investments in staff and management
   Executives said management at each store has been directed to "staff
   each restaurant as if it's a steep recovery," and to "be aggressive"
   with staffing so that when the recovery happens — whether it's swift or
   slow — the stores will be ready. Chipotle's thinking is that when new
   customers wander into stores or old customers come back, they should
   all get great customer service.
