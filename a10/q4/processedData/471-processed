Chipotle Cheese Dip Recipe

   This Chipotle Cheese Dip is ready in under 30 minutes and will be a
   crowd favorite!  Of course, you can always make it for just you and
   your family too üòâ  I love the flavor of chipotle, it has a bit of heat
   and a bit of smoke.  Added with the blend of cheese, like cream cheese
   and cheddar cheese, you have a recipe for an appetizer that you will be
   making for the Big Game that is coming up and on any day!

   My Chipotle Cheese Dip also has a bit of protein added to it for an
   extra layer of texture and deliciousness.

   Not only does this appetizer have chipotle peppers, but it has Chipotle
   TofuBaked from Nasoya. Chipotle TofuBaked is an easy and flavorful
   addition to my Chipotle Cheese Dip . It is a versatile ingredient that
   helps keep protein high and the flavor amazing.

   There are only a few ingredients you need to have to make this
   appetizer dish that is full of flavor.

   Once you have everything prepared, you just add everything into your
   mixing bowl.  Stir it well so all your ingredients are mixed together
   nicely.

   Once you bake it for about 25 minutes, the top will become a golden
   brown and the edges will start to bubble.

       I have not seen a recipe using tofu like this. It certainly looks
       delicious and great that it is low calorie and high protein.

       I have never tried this. I don‚Äôt eat tofu. I tried it once and
       wasn‚Äôt impressed. I did try it plain. I think it probably absorbs
       other flavors so I should try it in a recipe before condemning it.
