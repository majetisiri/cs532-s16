Why Chipotle Is Closing Its Stores Over The Lunch Rush

Closing down at such a busy time to teach employees about food safety sends a
strong message to the public.

   By Glenn Karwoski

   01/26/2016

   [90]« More Innovations
   If you were planning to grab a burrito the size of your head on the
   afternoon of February 8, fuggedaboutit.

   If you haven’t heard, that’s the day the recently maligned restaurant
   chain will close all of its stores sduring the lunch rush hour in order
   to talk to employees about food safety. During the closing, they’ll
   explain the why and how behind a series of food safety issues that left
   many customers sick with illnesses like norovirus, salmonella and E.
   coli – not anything you’d care to order off the menu.

   Do they really need to close the restaurant in order to get the message
   across to employees? Of course not.

   It’s a move reminiscent of Starbucks, which closed all of its stores in
   2008 for a three-hour “retraining” meeting for all of its employees
   about the Starbucks experience. It was also a way for Howard Schultz to
   send a message that he was back in charge after having stepped down.

   While the Starbucks play was more a rallying of the troops, Chipotle
   has bigger issues. Consumers weren’t afraid of getting E. coli at
   Starbucks.

   No, Chipotle is pulling a public relations stunt and letting news
   coverage of its event send a message to everybody. It’s more cost
   effective than trying to convince consumers through advertising that
   its safe to bite into a burrito from the chain, and to that extent,
   it’s a relatively innovative strategy.

   Of course, the once-heralded fast-food chain is going to lose sales
   being closed over the lunch hour. But then again, think of how
   expensive it would be if they had to buy all the coverage they’re going
   to get from the shutdown, not to mention all the publicity it has
   generated.

   Not a bad move.
