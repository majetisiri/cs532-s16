Elon Musk Cancels Blogger's Tesla Order After Critical Post

   Musk says all the attention from canceled order must mean it’s "a slow
   news day."

   Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk has canceled a venture capitalistʼs
   Tesla Motors Model X order after he wrote a blog post criticizing a
   Tesla event. In the original post on Medium titled "[35]Dear @ElonMusk:
   You should be ashamed of yourself," venture capitalist Stewart Alsop
   wrote of his frustration over a Model X launch event he attended.

   Alsop’s gripe was that he drove two and a half hours to the Model X
   launch event and arrived on time, but then was made to wait 30 minutes
   outside and then had to wait another hour inside, along with around
   3,000 other guests, before being moved to another room where everyone
   had to wait another 20 minutes for Elon Musk to appear.

   "Starting a[t] 7:00pm event at 8:50pm is simply unacceptable,
   particularly when the invited guests are actually your customers!"
   Alsop wrote. "But for you to stand up at 8:52pm and not even
   acknowledge that you have wasted your own customers’ time was
   insensitive and poor judgement."
   ""Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer
   gets this much attention," Musk said."

   Alsup says when Musk did take the stage, Musk opened with talking about
   the safety of the Model X. "Yup, you lead with safety, like that’s why
   we’re all spending $130,000 or more on this car!" Alsop wrote. "So, at
   9:00pm, two hours after arriving mostly just to see a Model X up close,
   I left."

   Alsop goes on to say he feels like he was mistreated. "I had been
   handed a badge that would let me test drive the model, but my badge
   number was 1,344. If you started the event one hour and 22 minutes
   late, I could only imagine that having 1,343 people in front of me to
   test drive a Model X would have kept me there until, I don’t know, 2:00
   AM. I made a tactical decision to give up early without ever actually
   seeing a Model X."

   He ended his post by saying that while he still wants a Model X, he now
   wonders if the mismanagement of the Model X launch event signals "other
   problems in managing Tesla as a company."

   Alsop’s post apparently hit its target—being read by Musk—because soon
   after Alsop [36]wrote another blog post saying Musk had called him and
   personally canceled his Model X order after reading the post.

   Alsop says Musk told him that he felt the blog post was a personal
   attack on himself and that as a result he was "not comfortable" having
   Alsop own a Tesla car. Addressing Musk in the second blog post, Alsop
   says he is "taken aback" to be banned by Tesla, but mostly, he says, he
   is sorry not to be able to take part in the "automobile revolution"
   Tesla started.

   "You have created a car company when everybody decided decades ago that
   it was not possible," Alsop wrote. "You have challenged the hateful and
   intimidating distribution system that forces people to be subjected to
   the hard sell even if they just want to buy a car they know they want.
   You have innovated on user experience, battery technology, autonomous
   operation, and virtually every other aspect of the automobile
   experience today. And you designed and produced a really beautiful and
   amazing car along the way!"

   As for Musk (who I swear has to be the inspiration for [37]Peter
   Facinelli’s Maxwell Lord on Supergirl), he simply responded on Twitter
   by writing "Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude
   customer gets this much attention."

   This isn’t the first time that Musk has canceled a customerʼs order. In
   January a Tesla customer says he didn’t get a refurbished Model S he
   ordered because [39]Musk was using it to test a new version of the
   company’s Autopilot software.

   Tesla then [40]issued a statement saying "Unfortunately, due to human
   error, a car from our test fleet was offered for sale. We apologize
   that this led to a frustrating experience. We are working to ensure
   that it never happens again."
