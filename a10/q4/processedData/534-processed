Copycat Chipotle Cilantro Lime Rice. Rubio's Chipotle but I am going to use
this to develop a Rubio's copycat recipe.

Chipotle's rice recipe REVIEW Recipe was great. I personally tripled (if not
more) the cilantro. I think it needs way more salt than what called for too.
All around great with some minor tweaks

Copycat Chipotle Cilantro Lime Rice- Typically make this with Bang Bang
Chicken, subbing in white rice for the jasmine. It's a great way to spice up
an otherwise boring side dish!

Copycat Chipotle Cilantro Lime Rice - A copycat recipe that's healthy and can
be tossed in a salad, a tortilla or just scooped up on the side.

Cilantro Lime Rice - I read that this was similar to Chipotle's rice (or even
Qdoba's). I didn't think it was. But this may be because I add butter to the
water (or broth, in this case) to cook the rice, which may alter the flavor
somewhat. Still, this is VERY good, and I will be making it again.

Cilantro Lime Rice, recipe is similar to Chipotle Cilantro Rice...I would
like to try this using quinoa.

I have been looking for a great cilantro lime rice recipe, Barbacoa has had
the best, hope this lives up to it.

Better than Takeout Chicken Fried Rice (also has links to a few other tasty

Better than Takeout Chicken Fried Rice - it was good, not exceptional. Part
of my problem was the rice I used was too fluffy and not right for this dish.
Additionally, it needed another seasoning but I'm not sure what as I've never
made take-out Chinese or any other oriental food before.

I mean really. Who doesn’t like fried rice? Ok maybe my six year old doesn’t
because of the veggies inside, but I am pretty sure he is the only one out
there. For my birthday dinner with my family I chose to go to our favorite
little chinese restaurant. And it was the bomb. …

{MAJOR WIN} beef with broccoli stir fry; so very good, and really is better
than take out. I omitted sherry and used frozen broccoli (nuked). Next time I
might add a pinch of red pepper flakes. And I would use the sauce (not the
marinade) for any other Chinese food, too :). Only took about 15 min to cook
(1hour for marinade).
