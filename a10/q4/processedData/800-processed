   Station in Washington. Chipotle says it will start a marketing push in
   February to begin its road to recovery after a series of food scares,
   and that it's confident it can win back customers over time. The
   remarks from executives come after Chipotle's sales plunged 30 percent
   in December. Its troubles began after an E. coli outbreak came to light
   at the end of October. Several weeks later, norovirus sickened dozens
   at a Chipotle in Boston. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File)

   WEST PALM BEACH - Chipotle is working to make its food safer after
   multiple outbreaks of food borne illness. The restaurant will close its
   doors for lunch Monday as it continues to focus on training its
   employees and rolling out new food safety initiatives. We found it took
   months to fix some issues in South Florida restaurants, which the
   restaurant says is not up to its standards. That's why the chain will
   now give restaurant managers an incentive to fix problems and pass
   inspections.

   The Dirty Dining team looked at inspection reports for Chipotle
   restaurants from Vero Beach to Boca Raton. We found two restaurants
   caught the attention of state inspectors, and may now face possible
   fines for not fixing issues in time.

   Despite making news headlines again and again as more outbreaks were
   reported, we found lines in South Florida Chipotle restaurants are
   still long. At a West Palm Beach location, the line was to the door
   three hours after the lunch hour.

   "I love their tacos," explained Michael Rzegocki. "I think I am ok
   because it hasn't happened here."

   The Consumer Watchdog found South Florida customers began complaining
   Chipotle made them sick after the outbreak. However, no cases of
   illness were confirmed by the state in South Florida.

   "I think possibly maybe people didn't feel so well when they ate there
   where normally they wouldn't say anything but after looking at the
   reports on television they turned and reported illness," explained food
   safety expert Fred Stein, of [124]Safe Food Connection .

   Some of those customers never went to the doctor. It's difficult to
   confirm a food related illness without testing. Typically, more than
   one person becomes ill when there's a problem.

   While nothing was discovered in South Florida, the state says four
   cases of illness were confirmed to be linked to Chipotle near Orlando.
   It's unclear what caused those customers to get sick.

   After every complaint, the state does a follow-up inspection.

   "I don't think about the back kitchen as much as I should," explained
   Rzegocki. "I don't check the inspection reports. I should but I don't."

   We checked the reports for you. All those complaints had inspectors
   going back to Chipotle restaurants in our area time and time again.
   Some didn't fix issues for several months.

   "Unfortunately from looking at the reports it seemed like it took quite
   a long time for those problems to be corrected," Stein said.

   Inspectors went to the Wellington Chipotle (1000 S. State Route 7) on
   six different dates since late July. They finally met state inspection
   standards during the December inspection.

   At the Port St. Lucie Chipotle (1768 SW St. Lucie West Blvd.) an
   inspector found a heavily stained cutting board that could no longer be
   cleaned. It was still in the restaurant two months later when the
   kitchen was cited by the state again. There were also issues with the
   temperature of some food in both inspections. The local inspector
   turned that case over to the state for a possible fine.

   The Boca Raton Chipotle (9930 Glades Road) may also face a fine for not
   fixing violations in time.

   "What a restaurant should do is correct the violations immediately.
   That's really to their benefit and the benefit of the public," Stein
   said.

   Chipotle responded to our findings adding that these are not in line
   with their high expectations. They have a plan to address it.

   Restaurants rely on inspections from the state, but some also do their
   own to make sure food and kitchens are consistently meeting standards.

   "For 2016, we are increasing the frequency of audits of our restaurants
   for food safety and health issues and commissioning quarterly
   inspections from an independent third party. Fifty percent of our
   restaurant managers’ bonuses will be contingent on scores from those
   audits."

   Now there will be a financial incentive for restaurant managers to keep
   the kitchens clean.

   While there have been no confirmed cases in South Florida of food
   related illness tied to Chipotle, the Florida Department of Health says
   four cases of illness were confirmed at Orange County Chipotle
   restaurants. It's unclear what caused those issues.

   To make sure there are no more food borne illness outbreaks, the
   restaurant is rolling out a new food safety plan.

   "Most of the new protocols are already in place, thanks to the hard
   work and dedication of our excellent restaurant teams. Additionally, we
   have implemented unprecedented food safety standards with our
   suppliers, which make the food coming into our restaurants safer than
   ever before," explained Steve Ells, founder, chairman and co-CEO of
   Chipotle.

   Chipotle will now prepare some items like tomatoes, lettuce, and cheese
   in off-site kitchens. Also, restaurants will blanch onions, avocados,
   and limes in the restaurant as well as marinate the chicken and steak
   in a new way to make sure it's safe.

   Ingredients will also be subject to high resolution DNA testing to make
   sure they are safe when shipped to the Chipotle restaurants across the
   country. Chipotle

   says this testing far exceeds state and federal regulations as well as
   industry standards.

   Employees will also get paid sick time so they don't work while sick.

   Chipotle will go over these changes, some of which have already rolled
   out, on Monday. The chain will be closed for lunch and reopen at 3:00
   PM.

   While food safety will be a big topic, we found some South Florida
   restaurants don't have the required Florida food safety training. More
   than two months after the inspector brought that to the Chipotle's
   attention at 9930 Glades Road in Boca Raton, the restaurant was cited
   again.

   "If that's not in place, people can get sick," Stein said.

   "That's a problem right there especially with fast food. You are
   dealing with people's lives. You have to stay on top of that,"
   explained customer Clemon Jones.

   Something Chipotle fans believe the restaurant will do now that the
   chain is under the microscope.
