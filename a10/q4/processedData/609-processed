DIY Tesla Model S and X Ultra-Bright LED Interior Light Kit

   [49]Home »[50]DIY » DIY Tesla Model S and X Ultra-Bright LED Interior
   Light Kit

   Posted By [51]Rob M. on Feb 4, 2016

   The Model S has interior lights in most of the right places – puddle
   lights beneath the doors, foot well lighting, trunk and frunk lighting
   – but the problem lies in its inability to provide useable light. This
   is especially the case in the trunk area where its near impossible to
   see your belonging in the dark of night. I wouldn’t classify myself as
   being the most handy person, but when I came across a thread discussing
   an aftermarket [52]Ultra-Bright LED interior lighting kit, I decided to
   flex my do-it-yourself muscles and give it a go.

   My DIY skills mainly centers around anything that has a keyboard and
   monitor. Anything outside of that is a crap shoot. My wife measures
   my success by counting how many parts I damage when tackling a project,
   which may include body parts. There’s the “1 finger job” (1 damaged
   finger) all the way up to projects involving leg injuries. I’m just not
   that handy, though I must say that my [53]Blackvue dashcam project came
   out pretty nicely.

   This LED interior lighting kit was simple enough to make it the perfect
   DIY Tesla Model S project for me.

Ultra-Bright LED Interior Light Kit

   Abstract Ocean, best known for their “Fobpocket” key fob holders, also
   sells ultra-bright LED interior lights for the Model S and X. The light
   assemblies are drop in replacements for the Tesla OEM lights and sold
   in sets of 1, 4, 8 and 13. At $12.99 a bulb ($11.50 on [54]Amazon
   Prime) it’s certainly not the cheapest but then again I don’t really
   have a frame of reference for what Ultra-Bright LED
   assemblies should cost.

   Before you order the lights, check how many you will need. This depends
   on the age of your Model S and whether you have the [55]premium
   interior lighting package or not. The red dots in the picture below
   (courtesy of Abstract Ocean) show the possible locations for interior
   lighting:

   [56]Possible Interior light locations

   In some cases, even if you don’t have the premium interior lighting
   package and are missing some lights, you may be able to add additional
   lighting by following the excellent [57]installation
   instructions outlined on Abstract Ocean’s site. On my Model S, I have
   the factory premium interior lighting package which has 13 light
   assemblies.

   Each light is a direct replacement for the factory light in your Model
   S, not to mention they’re 16x brighter. Abstract Ocean has this to say
   about the brightness:

     Bear in mind that perception of light is not on a linear scale, so
     although technically 16x brighter, the perceived reality will be
     less than that, as most of the interior surfaces tend to absorb
     light. The reality though, is that these make a dramatic difference
     to the lighting in your Model S

   In addition to the lights, there’s one more item you’ll want to have
   handy and that is the [58]spudger tool which will aid you in popping
   out the factory light assemblies.

Installation

   Trunk Ultra-Bright LED Lighting

   The Abstract Ocean installation instructions break down the
   installation into 5 parts in increasing levels of difficulty. I was
   short one bulb so I only did 4 parts but none of them were beyond my
   mediocre skill level. The first part of the instruction guides you
   though the installation of the trunk light. This is an excellent place
   to start as the lights in this location are the most accessible, and
   serves as a good place for practice. This is also where you’ll become
   familiar with prying the fixture out using the tip of the spudger tool.

   The trunk lights are easier to remove since they’re pushed into the
   soft carpeted trunk linings versus being deeply recessed into hard
   plastic. I found that climbing into the trunk made for better access to
   the lights.
   [60][Light-popped-out-412x275.jpg]
   [61][Hatch-light-413x275.jpg]

   To remove a light, you pry from one side (try the other if one side
   seems too difficult) and then gently pop the light assembly out. Each
   light has a cable that clicks and latches into place on the light.
   Depress the latch and pull the cable off. Replace the factory light
   with the new LED assembly.

   Once installed you will notice a drastic difference in illumination.

   [62]Updated Trunk Lights at night


   Installing the Frunk light

   The front trunk (frunk) has just one interior light right at the front
   of the frunk making it slightly more difficult to access just because
   of the angle in which your body is positioned when facing the car. But
   once you get the spudger tool in place, popping the light out is fairly
   simple.

   As an aside I’ve noticed that the inside of my frunk gets pretty
   dusty/dirty over time even though I rarely open it. I suspect it isn’t
   well sealed from the elements. I’ve never noticed it to be wet inside,
   but there is an accumulation of dust and dirt that I wouldn’t expect. I
   keep extension cables/adapters in there so its not a major concern but
   if you keep groceries or something else in there you may want to keep
   an eye on it and perhaps ask Tesla if its sealed correctly.

   Anyhow, here’s the [63]Ultra-Bright LED light installed in the frunk.

   [64]Updated Frunk Lights at night


   Installing Puddle lights

   On the bottom of each of the four doors is what Tesla calls a “Puddle
   light” which helps illuminate/puddle the area where you step in and out
   of your vehicle. These puddle lights come with the optional Model S
   premium interior lighting upgrade.

   Popping these lights out is simple, but once again getting to it is
   tricky since they’re mounted upside down beneath each door. I found
   that laying down on the floor while looking upwards was the best way to
   gain access. Having a blanket,  towel or a nice clean garage floor to
   lay on would help.

   [65]Puddle light


   Installing the foot well lights

   Difficulty level 4 (still pretty simple) is upgrading the foot well
   lights. Again, this is all about gaining access and perfecting
   your angle of attack. The front passenger footwell light is just above
   the are where a passenger’s feet would be. I found this one hard just
   because I’m right handed and the light is on the left. The solution was
   to lay down on the floor mat and look upwards towards the light.

   [66]Passenger light

   The driver’s side foot well light was easier as it was on my
   right side, but the trick with this one is maneuvering around the
   pedals. The light is right above the accelerator pedal so you have to
   reach in quite a ways. Get creative with your angles and you’ll be able
   to pop the light out with ease.

   [67]Driver Light

   It turns out these front foot well lights were a warm up for the Boss
   part of level 4 — the rear footwell lights. These lights are attached
   to mountings that clip onto a horizontal bar located under the front
   seats. To access these you want to raise the rear of the front seats
   all the way up (but not move them forward).

   Followed by carefully pulling each side of the light bracket towards
   you until it pops off the bar. Undo the cable and separate the light
   from its plastic mount.
   [68]Rear floor light in
   [69]Rear floor light out

   Getting the light out of the plastic mount without doing damage takes a
   bit of finesse but if I can do it then so can you. My suggestion is to
   wedge the tip of the spudger in and then slightly turn it until the
   edge of the light sticks out enough for you to grab and remove. Just be
   careful as its pretty easy to damage the plastic mount. [70]Abstract
   Ocean sells spares which evidently can also be used to add rear
   footwell lighting to a Model S without the premium interior lighting
   package. Once you have the light out, popping the new one in is easy.
   Re-attach the cable and then press the clips back onto the bar.

   The puddle and foot well lights together make for a huge difference.

   [71]Updated Puddle Lights at night


   Installing the Glove box light

   I only had 12 bulbs so I didn’t get a chance to take on level 5. The
   instructions make it sound a bit more difficult than the others as the
   space is tight and access is limited, but I suspect it wouldn’t be too
   difficult if you play around with your angles.

Summary

   The [72]Abstract Ocean Ultra-Bright LED Interior Light Kit provides a
   simple and elegant way to improve the interior lighting in your Model
   S. The lights are direct replacements for the factory lights, and
   their excellent [73]installation instructions provide you all the
   help you need to get the job done. Even for a non-handy but self made
   DIY’er like myself. The lights are also [74]available on Amazon and
   eligible for free 1-2 day shipping if you have Amazon Prime.

   In daylight the lights are noticeably brighter, At night they make the
   world of difference. It took me approximately 30 minutes to replace all
   12 lights and that included the time it took for me to document this
   process by taking photos.

   In the end it brings me great pleasure to say this was a zero finger
   job – no body parts were damaged during the making of this project (a
   minor miracle) and, perhaps more importantly, I didn’t do any damage to
   my Model S 🙂

   I’d definitely recommend the lights. They’ve been selling like hot
   cakes across TMC so there may be a bit of a wait to get them. Well
   worth it in my opinion.

   Summary

   At $12.99 per Ultra-Bright LED assembly, the cost might seem a bit
   high, that is until you realize these are direct plug and play, drop in
   replacements to the factory Tesla OEM lights.

   In daylight the lights are noticeably brighter, At night they make the
   world of difference. All in all an excellent upgrade to enhance the
   interior lighting of your Tesla Model S.

       Have they become tiring because of their brightness at night? From
       the pictures they look very bright. Great job on the write-up, and
       thanks for the info.
          + Farmer_Dave
            I have the same question. I’d also like to see the effect in a
            Model X, especially for the dome light,which is practically
            useless for the driver.
          + [84]Teslaliving
            These are all in places where they’d only come on when you’re
            parked or the doors/frunk/trunk are open. When driving you
            won’t see them. Also when parked you wouldn’t use any of these
            for reading, you’d use the push vanity lights. They’re
            basically for seeing stuff when you’re getting in/out of the
            car or putting stuff in or taking stuff out of the car and
            they help.
     * Electric Steve
       I have a mid 2014 S85 and my Frunk is still clean (and i’ve never
       cleaned it or anything). I store a spare wheel there (not possible
       with awd versions) and groceries and the seals seem to do a good
       job. Done 70k km with the car.
       So i don’t think the frunk-dirt problem is not universal as you are
       writing…
          + [85]Teslaliving
            I didnt mean to imply it was universal, just something i’ve
            seen on mine. Sorry if it sounded otherwise.
     * Marco Papa
       First of all let me start with saying that these lights are
       fantastic.
       But the recommended ‘spudger tool’ is absolutely positively
       useless. I started with the light in the trunk hatch and I must
       have tried 30 times. Nothing. The tip of the spudger tool just
       bends too much (it’s plastic) and it is too thin at the top. So I
       checked on Amazon and saw 5 other people having identical issue.
       One reviewer recommended to use just a simple screwdriver. So I
       went in my toolbox and found a long flat tip screwdriver with the
       tip exactly the size of the little indentation on one side of each
       of the light units. With that screwdriver I had to just push it in
       a quarter inch and slightly twist against the walls and boom in
       less than two seconds, with hardly any force, all the lights would
       pop out, even the ones rated as ‘difficult’ in the instructions.
       Bottom line, don’t buy the spudger tool, and instead just invest in
       a $2 plain old screwdriver.
       Now I am really happy that these lights were recommended, and
       appreciate all the instructions given here, especially the ones
       about the back foot well lights. I highly recommend them. And since
       they are LEDs, they consume very little power.
          + [86]Teslaliving
            Thats odd as I used only the spudger and it worked great for
            me. A few were fairly tight but I didnt have the trouble
            others have reported.
               o Marco Papa
                 The reviewers from both Amazon and Abstract Ocean that
                 reported the issues with the lights being very hard to
                 remove seem to have a late model Tesla Model S. I have a
                 5-month old Model S P90D.
               o [87]Teslaliving
                 Ah could be mine is older and that made them easier.
               o Marco Papa
                 I just received the 3 red side-doors LED lights from
                 Abstract Ocean. The are really easy to remove with a
                 screwdriver, but not with the spudger tool. I used some
                 tape over the wall to ensure that I do not scratch the
                 plastic. They make a hell of a difference compared to the
                 stick red lights.
               o [88]Teslaliving
                 Interesting. I didnt get the red ones yet but perhaps I
                 should.
