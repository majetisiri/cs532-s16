   La Morena

   There is nothing like some good ol‚Äô latin food! Am I right? I miss my
   moms cooking so much! I think my all time favorite was Mami‚Äôs Milanesa
   De Pollo! ¬°Qu√© delicioso! I decided to keep my moms memory alive by
   recreating her milanesa- but with a chipotle sauce twist! I headed over
   to my local mexican bodega here in NYC and purchased some products from
   [27]LA MORENA to help create my Milanesa De Pollo With A Chipotle
   twist!

   La Morena
   It was so hard to choose, but I ultimately ended up choosing the
   chipotle peppers to work with in this meal!
   Let‚Äôs see what I whip up with the Jalape√±o peppers in the near future!

   Latin Food Cilantro Lime Rice

   My mom usually made arroz blanco with her milanesa, but I decided to do
   a cilantro lime rice for this meal.

   Cilantro Lime Rice
   1/2 cup of cilantro
   Salt (to taste)
   2 Tablespoons of lime juice
   2 Tablespoons of water

   Mix all ingredients with some already cooked plain rice and voila!

   Latin Food

              Mami‚Äôs Milanesa De Pollo With A Chipotle Twist

   Ingredients:
   (1) 7oz La Morena Chipotle Peppers Can
   (1) Egg
   Salt
   Pepper
   Breadcrumbs
   Chicken Breasts

                                 Directions:

   Mix up the La Morena Chipotle Peppers in a food processor. Marinate
   chicken breasts with salt,pepper, egg and the newly mixed La Morena
   Chipotle Peppers. Let marinate for a bit to absorb the flavor. Dip
   chicken breasts into breadcrumbs, then fry!


   La Morena

   I am so happy with how my Milanesa De Pollo With Chipotle came out!
   The La Morena Chipotle Peppers gave the chicken just the right amount
   of spiciness. And the cilantro lime rice was so delicious as well! I
   topped off my chicken with a bit of La Morena Home Made Style Red
   Mexican sauce and a little lime on the side. !Delicioso! Mami would be
   proud! A simple but delicious meal to make! With it being Hispanic
   Heritage Month I am sure my mom is happy that I am embracing my latina
   roots and sharing them with my daughter as well. I want her to grow up
   being proud of her latina roots!

   Thanks for stopping by!
   Hope you enjoyed this #CollectiveBias post!

       I love Mexican spices‚Äìalthough they don‚Äôt always love me! This
       chicken sounds delicious. Guess I will have to find a Bodega near
       me or next time I am in NYC find one there.

       I‚Äôm not sure how i‚Äôd do with chipotle since I‚Äôm the biggest wimp
