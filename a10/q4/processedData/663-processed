30-Minute Homemade Marinara Sauce: Made with fresh tomatoes ~ This sauce only
cooks for 30 minutes before it’s ready to enjoy. If you like a chunky
marinara, serve it as-is. I typically use my immersion blender to puree it
just a bit. You could also give it a post-cooking whirl in the food processor
if you prefer. Just let it slightly cool down first and don’t over-process
it…you don’t want it to end up perfectly smooth. Vegan • Gluten free

Frozen bananas are a pretty magical ingredient; not only do they add
sweetness and body to a host of recipes, but they also pack a nutritional
punch. Moreover, freezing this staple fruit puts overripening on pause,
avoiding food waste.

In the middle of a heat wave? Don't give up on cooking entirely. Instead,
stay cool during these dog days of Summer with these no-cook recipe ideas,
including everything from breakfast to salads to sweets - none of which
require the use of your oven or your stove. - Additional reporting by Hilary

Meat is an excellent source of protein for building muscle and keeping you
full, but going for fatty cuts and processed meats isn't so good for your
waistline or your health. Instead, opt for the leanest cuts of meat in order
to keep your meals at a normal calorie count.

that potatoes are the food that helped people feel the most satisfied. The
skin of a potato is full of fiber and the starch doesn't have a ton of
