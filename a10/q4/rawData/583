There are only about 30,000 electric cars now on German roads.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_488291462\" align=\"\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"dam-image getty size-large wp-image-488291462\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/488291462/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> Porsche Mission E at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show on September 15, 2015 .

Tesla&rsquo;s share price is now close to $175, after having fallen more than 40 percent from its high last July of $286.\r\n\r\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said he cut the target because sales prospects of the new Model X SUV, currently reaching its first customers, and the mass market little Model 3 have been scaled back. Jonas though still has faith in Tesla&rsquo;s albeit risky long-term viability.\r\n\r\nJonas said, in a report, that the Model X was about one year late and may have added hundreds of millions of dollars to costs and possibly lost some customers. Development of the Model 3 has suffered because technical resources have been concentrating on the Model X. Jonas still expects the Model 3 to be about a year late.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Our revised 2020 forecasts for complete vehicle deliveries is less than half of Tesla&rsquo;s 500,000 unit target. [tweet_quote display=\"We expect the Model 3 to be a really nice car, just a bit rarer than many expected,&rdquo; Jonas said.\"]We expect the Model 3 to be a really nice car, just a bit rarer than many expected,&rdquo; Jonas said.[/tweet_quote]</p><!--nextpage-->\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_f2ff03f243814942b8e5f06e3f7643c0\" align=\"\" width=\"960\"]<img class=\"dam-image ap size-large wp-image-f2ff03f243814942b8e5f06e3f7643c0\" src=\"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/f2ff03f243814942b8e5f06e3f7643c0/960x0.jpg?fit=scale\" alt=\"\"> Audi e-tron quattro concept at the Frankfurt Auto Show . (AP Photo/Jens Meyer)[/caption]\r\n\r\nJonas expects annual sales of the Model S, X and 3 to total 246,000 by 2020 compared with Tesla&rsquo;s 500,000 forecast. Model 3 deliveries will only reach 5,000 in 2018, not the planned 30,000.\r\n\r\nBerenberg Bank of Germany has just started coverage of Tesla with a &ldquo;sell&rdquo; recommendation and a one-year target share price of $165.\r\n\r\nBerenberg analyst Adam Hull said Tesla&rsquo;s progress has been impressive, but points out that its enterprise value of about $27 billion is more than twice that of Mercedes. Its profitability lags the Germans.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Excluding government incentives, Tesla&rsquo;s true core gross margin in the luxury car segment is not the headline 24 percent, but under 20 percent, whereas we think Mercedes and BMW achieve 35 to 40 percent,&rdquo; &nbsp;Hull said.\r\n\r\nMany of Tesla&rsquo;s competitors will accept large losses on electric vehicles until 2025, he said. The strong U.S. dollar will also undermine Tesla, while it will lose U.S. federal incentives of $7,500 per car before 2019 while laggard competitor cars will still get it.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming [entity display=\"Porsche\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"porsche\" natural_id=\"fred/company/101910\"]Porsche[/entity] Mission E, [entity display=\"Audi\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"audi\" natural_id=\"fred/company/91198\"]Audi[/entity] Q6 e-tron Quattro SUV and Volkswagen Phaeton battery-only sedan will be released by 2018.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The German premium brands are investing heavily and have good electric vehicle and autonomous driving technology but they are slow to release, partly to defend profits. We expect news from Mercedes and the BMW (i5) soon, and more competition from Range Rover, Volvo and Japanese manufacturers,&rdquo; Hull said.\r\n\r\nNot everybody thinks the Germans will roll over Tesla when they finally get their electric cars to market.\r\n<!--nextpage-->\r\n&ldquo;Just because other manufacturers [like Audi and Porsche]&nbsp;announced their entry into the electric car space, doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;ll be able to turn something around that quickly -- let alone something that will resonate with consumers,&rdquo; said Max Zanan, co-founder and CEO of IDDS Group.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Building an electric car requires a totally different approach to manufacturing, [tweet_quote display=\"if there was an actual threat to Tesla, traditional car makers would&rsquo;ve entered in to the electric car space by now,&rdquo;\"]if there was an actual threat to Tesla, traditional car makers would&rsquo;ve entered in to the electric car space by now,&rdquo;[/tweet_quote] Zanan said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bernstein Research analyst Max Warburton, Tesla is &ldquo;excessively vertically integrated, will struggle to scale its manufacturing and does not have a durable technological lead. The Germans are determined to disrupt the disrupter.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;The German [manufacturers] are also studying smaller, lower-priced EVs to rival the Model 3, although they are really struggling with costs on these cars. Will these products grow the overall luxury EV segment, or will it just become a market share game? We think it will probably [be the latter],&rdquo; he said.\r\n\r\nDespite its latest negative short-term thoughts on Tesla, Morgan Stanley still believes it has a long-term future as a high risk, potentially high reward investment because it addresses the three greatest changes in the auto industry &ndash; electrification, autonomous driving and shared mobility. Tesla may still be the best positioned manufacturer for the next stage of technology development, but its current position &ldquo;is not yet truly disruptive to the automotive industry.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s modern, lean structure could give it a big competitive advantage, for investors willing to take risks, Morgan Stanley said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</p>","description":"Investors are losing faith in Tesla's long-term prospects, with some analysts saying its relatively small scale will make it difficult to compete with established German manufacturers that are belatedly but busily readying competitive products.","image":"http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/490598496/960x0.jpg?fit=scale","imageHeight":638,"imageWidth":960,"type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2016/02/04/tesla-share-price-slides-as-sales-projections-cut-opposition-looms/","comments":[],"visible":true,"blogId":"2861","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/982449","name":"Neil Winton","avatars":[{"size":136,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/486656dcd4c1638d09d5665df256bf6b?s=136&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":40,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/486656dcd4c1638d09d5665df256bf6b?s=40&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":400,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/486656dcd4c1638d09d5665df256bf6b?s=400&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"},{"size":62,"image":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/486656dcd4c1638d09d5665df256bf6b?s=62&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/","type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/neilwinton/","twitterName":"@wintonsauto","authorType":"individual","email":"neil.winton@btinternet.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I cover Europe’s car manufacturers, their business, tech, products","webSite":"http://www.wintonsworld.com","timestamp":1459780868608,"description":"As a former European Automotive correspondent for Reuters, I’ve a spent a few years writing about the industry.
