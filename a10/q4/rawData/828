You\u0027re darn tootin\u0027 I wouldn\u0027t appreciate it if someone took a steamy hot dump all over my clean windshield. Unfortunately, that\u0027s what apparently happened to this poor Chicago guy named \u0022Michael\u0022 who took to Craigslist to kvetch about a very inconspicuous poop someone had left on the windshield of his nice Model X. And now he\u0027s out for VENGEANCE.\u000A\u000ALet\u0027s just pretend this is real, k?\u000A\u000AObviously I have a large degree of humility when writing this because\u000AI am seeking people out here to see if anyone has any information\u000Aabout who may have taken a gigantic shit on the windshield of my brand\u000Anew Tesla Model X.\u000A\u000AThis has to be a joke.\u000A\u000AThis is not a joke.\u000A\u000AVery dope, thank you for clarifying that. \u0022Michael\u0022 goes on: \u000A\u000ANow I know a lot of people might find this funny but my date was\u000Areally traumatized by the whole thing and I have zero leads. What\u0027s\u000Amore, the CPD \u0022absolutely refused\u0022 to help me, a tax paying citizen,\u000Aclean the shit off of my car. But they obviously didn\u0027t hesitate to\u000Atell me I could not drive with the poop on my windshield because it\u000Awould obstruct my visibility. I had to use a redeye magazine and\u000Abottle of water to clean it off and that sucked.\u000A\u000AImagine the obituary. (Cause of death: too much poop on windshield, couldn\u0027t see.) \u000A\u000A\u0022Michael\u0022 concludes his note with a threat (\u0022I will find you\u0022) and that the poop-layin\u0027 perp better lawyer the hell up, because \u0022taking dumps on a person\u0027s car is something children do, not adults.\u0022 Hell hath no fury like a Tesla owner wrapping up a date only to find adult poops all over his electric vehicle.",
