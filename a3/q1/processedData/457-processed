ANALYSIS: Chipotle Is a victim of Corporate Sabotage

   [311]February 5, 2016February 5, 2016 / [312]Culture of Awareness

   [313]Chipotle-corporate-sabotage-e-coli-bioterrorism-640 Wednesday,
   December 23, 2015
   by Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, Thanks to [314]Golden Age of Gaia

   Biotech industry food terrorists are planting e.coli in retaliation for
   restaurant’s anti-GMO menu
   (NaturalNews) After observing recent events involving Chipotle and
   e.coli, here’s my analysis of the situation: Chipotle’s e.coli
   outbreaks are not random chance. They are the result of the biotech
   industry unleashing bioterrorism attacks against [315]the only fast
   food company that has publicly denounced GMOs.

   Doctor Oz, for example, was maliciously targeted in a defamation
   campaign funded by the biotech industry earlier this year. The
   onslaught against Oz was initiated because he publicly expressed his
   support for honest GMO labeling on foods.

   As the attacks escalated, Doctor Oz had his own team investigate the
   source of the attacks and [316]found they were all biotech industry
   shills, some with felony criminal records and long histories of dubious
   propaganda activities targeting anti-GMO activists.

GMO industry routinely resorts to tactics that resemble terrorism or criminal
mafias

   As a clean food advocate myself, I know firsthand of the malicious
   tactics used by these biotech mafia operations, including tactics of
   intimidation and terrorism, such as calling in bomb threats to
   locations where clean food activists are about to speak.

   There is absolutely no question that the biotech industry will resort
   to ANY activity necessary to destroy food companies that oppose GMOs.
   And yes, this includes acts of bioterrorism against Chipotle —
   something that’s ridiculously easy for biotech industry operatives to
   carry out with simple, low-cost laboratory supplies sold online at
   places like Amazon.com.

   In my [317]HealthRangerReport.com podcast, shown below, I am now openly
   encouraging Chipotle’s management to initiate a criminal investigation
   with the FBI to attempt to identify the sources of this corporate
   sabotage campaign.

   To be clear, what’s really happening at Chipotle is that biotech
   industry shills are deliberately contaminating Chipotle’s food with
   strains of e.coli in a malicious attempt to destroy both the reputation
   and finances of the Chipotle food chain. This act of bioterrorism is
   entirely consistent with the known behavior patterns of the biotech
   industry which, for example, engaged in [318]illegal money laundering
   in Washington state in order to destroy the GMO labeling bill there.

   The biotech industry not only sells deadly glyphosate herbicide poison
   that destroys human health (and contaminates ecosystems), it also uses
   its [319]dirty money to financially influence academics, journalists
   and lawmakers. Those individuals who don’t fall into line with the
   biotech agenda are then treated to intense campaigns of defamation,
   slander, intimidation and threats to try to silence or discredit them.

   And when that doesn’t work, biotech industry operatives will literally
   engage in acts of terrorism like we’re seeing right now with Chipotle.
   To understand the biotech industry, you have to first understand that
   these are truly EVIL people who have no ethical boundaries whatsoever.
   They will target and destroy any person, any institution or any public
   company that they see as standing in their way of total world
   domination over the seed supply (and hence the food supply). The idea
   that exposing the public to e.coli might be harmful to some people
   doesn’t cause them to hesitate for even a moment. The more people get
   sick or die from their Chipotle operation, the better for biotech!
