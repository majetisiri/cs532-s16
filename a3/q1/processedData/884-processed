Tesla Motors Twitter Hack and Website Defacement: More Than Just a Domain
Hijack

   April 28, 2015 [67]vbulden [68]Hackers [69]0 Comment

Observations on the Tesla Motors Twitter Hack and Website Defacement: More Than
Just a Domain Hijack

   What you’re about to read is a rough break-down of the Tesla Motors
   Twitter and teslamotors.com
   website defacement, and also the possibility of the compromise of one
   of the “AkamaiGHost” web caching/mirror servers Tesla Motors appeared
   to
   be utilizing for redundancy or load-balancing at the time of the hack,
   a
   detail no one really mentioned during or post-occurrence…So I thought
   I’d share my findings.

   It is also my personal opinion that during the dissemination of
   information about the hack (via twitter), that dis-information was
   purposefully propagated in an effort to misdirect attention away from
   the initial compromise.

   “In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by
   a bodyguard of lies.” – Winston S. Churchill

   Mid-day, On Saturday April 25th 2015, information about a
   Tesla Motors twitter account take-over started flowing unto the fragile
   webs, followed by the take-over of the official Elon Musk twitter
   account:

   Both accounts obviously indicating they were freshly compromised by a
   “RIPPRGANG”, which will later be found to be LizardSquad.

   Upon seeing this, I head over to [70]http://www.teslamotors.com to find
   that it, had also been hacked:

   It read, “Hacked by Autismsquad!”
   Naturally, I checked out the HTML source, which, at the time, was
   viewed
   from a machine in the US… (more on geo-location later and how it was
   critical to the findings later on in this analysis).

   Here’s the source code of the content that would eventually make its
   way around the internet (just a quick “view-source” from my browser):

   A copy of the complete source can also be found here:
   [71]http://hastebin.com/raw/egipewexib

   As time passed, literally minutes into the hack, several theories began
   to emerge:
     * The Twitter accounts weren’t configured to use two-factor auth, and
       were brute-forced, and accessed due to weak passwords and/or
       password
       re-use across multiple twitter accounts, although this wouldn’t
       have
       explained the website defacement, unless those same exact
       credentials
       were being used for the Network Solutions control panel.

     * The domain registrar login information for teslamotors.com,
       registered with Network Solutions, was social engineered, and from
       there, DNS modifications were made. Specifically, the MX records, A
       and
       NS records were also changed to point to an IP address controlled
       by the
       attackers. From there, they would issue a password reset and would
       receive all mail for that domain (including the new
       credentials/temporary link, whatever it is with twitter.) With a
       change
       in A and NS records, the attackers would have complete control as
       to
       what IP address the domain would ultimately end up resolving to,
       which
       would host the hacked page. (This theory ends up being the one
       everyone
       runs with)

     * Another theory would include social engineering AT&T to get all
       phone calls to a legit number forwarded to another number that the
       attackers controlled, which could then have been used to change the
       domain details at Network Solutions using that particular
       verification
       method. This is actually the method put forth by a Tesla Motors
       Press
       Release, but not one which I particularly subscribe to.

   At the end of the day, the steps, in order, would had to have been
   something like:

   1. Social Engineer your way through Network Solutions’ Customer service
   to get access to the domain details, DNS settings, etc.
   2. Modify the MX record to point to a mail server you control. Also
   modify the A and NS records, and point the TLD and www subdomain to an
   IP hosting the “Autismsquad” page.
   3. Receive all mail for the teslamotors.com domain.
   4. Request a password reset for the twitter accounts.

Further Down the Lizard Hole

   It was time to get some specifics, technically.

   From a machine far-away on the other side of the planet (Japan), I run
   an nslookup on the teslamotors.com domain which showed that it was
   resolving to a 69.192.182.25 IP:

   This is an Akamai IP address, running their “AkamaiGHost” HTTP
   accelerator/Mirror service.

   This didn’t make sense at first, because it’s not often you come
   across a defaced page, being hosted on one of these unless it was a
   truly compromised box. Not typical of a DNS-Hijack, and there had been
   early confirmation (on twitter) of a digital ocean box that had been
   hosting the defaced content. So the fact that this was Akamai didn’t
   make much sense right away.

   My initial thought was that DNS propagation hadn’t made it to Japan
   yet. I had to react quickly to get an idea of the content that was
   sitting on the 69.192.182.25 (e7797.x.akamaiedge.net):

   $wget [72]http://www.teslamotors.com/index.html

   In any other situation, what I would have gotten would be the defaced
   index.html
   file that would match the hacked HTML source earlier in this analysis,
   in the “Autismsquad” defacement, but this wasn’t the case.

   What I actually ended up getting was an un-modified teslamotors.com
   index page. Which I identified by the Title tag, and the build
   information comment at the bottom of the source:

   This, to me, indicated that the original teslamotors.com
   site was still accessible from my machine in Japan, which sort of
   confirmed the “DNS hasn’t propagated to Japan” theory so far…Ok…

   Get a little more info. A quick version scan of TCP/80 revealed an
   http-robots.txt file with some disallows defined:

   I grab the INSTALL.pgsql.txt and INSTALL.sqlite.txt files.

   The files referenced in the robots disallow are remnants indicative of
   a Drupal installation and are publicly accessible.

   The INSTALL.pgsql.txt file
   with a default Drupal install, usually explains how to create some
   tables and database users for your installation, but not in this case…

   This is where it gets interesting…

   $wget [73]http://www.teslamotors.com/INSTALL.pgsql.txt

   We’ve downloaded the INSTALL.pgsql.txt file.

   INSTALL.pgsql.txt (2,638 bytes)
   MD5: 731ede73118b9c24f788752f76becd4c
   Just to be clear, an ORIGINAL, unmodified Drupal 7 INSTALL.pgsql.txt
   file that I later downloaded had an MD5 of
   3f682f768267764ca2c4a2d0e88660e6 and a file size of 1,874 bytes.

   To my surprise, the contents of the INSTALL.pgsql.txt
   were not the standard Drupal database config instructions, but rather,
   defacement code which pointed to “LizardSquad”, rather than
   “Autismsquad” that we saw in the “live” defacement page:

   The only difference between the actually hosted defacement page source
   code, and the source code hidden in the INSTALL.pgsql.txt
   file, was the attribution, which noted LizardSquad, and some other
   minor details, like the dimensions of the embedded YouTube video.

   I think it’s safe to say, that the Akamai box, is physically
   hosting a version of the HTML source code of the defacement, but hiding
   within the INSTALL.pgsql.txt and INSTALL.sqlite.txt files, which I have
   the original downloaded files posted [74]here, and [75]here,
   respectively.

   It’s at this point that I realize that somewhere along the way, the
   hack started as “LizardSquad”, and ended up evolving into an
   “Autismsquad” hack. The interesting piece here being that these
   modified
   Drupal INSTALL* files were physically being hosted on a machine
   controlled and owned by Akamai/Tesla, as we can confirm via the SSL
   certs’ “commonName” identifier on the 69.192.182.25 (Akamai) mirror
   machine:

   These facts, indicate that this Tesla/Akamai machine had been accessed
   (at some point), and the INSTALL.pgsql.txt and INSTALL.mysql.txt
   files were modified, and their contents replaced with “Lizardsquad”
   tagged defacement HTML source code, which would later be modified, and
   used in the Autismsquad DNS Hijack.

   Questions still remain however… how was the akamai box compromised?
   Was it accessed as part of the Network Solutions Social Engineering
   phase? Was it compromised via a Drupal 7 exploit? 0day? Were the
   credentials to an Akamai LUNA control panel compromised via the the
   aforementioned SE methods? What are your thoughts? Did I step into some
   weird LizardSquad wormhole? I’m tired. And going to bed. Good Night,
   Good Morning, whatever it may be.
