   don't be sour

When life gave Chipotle lemons, it put them behind the counter

   No, really.

   Chipotle is making a variety of efforts to improve food cleanliness and
   safety after [23]sales-crushing problems with E. coli and norovirus
   last quarter. Apparently as part of that, the company seems to have
   moved the lemon slices it once kept out for food and drinks behind the
   counter. The Street’s Brian Sozzi [24]tweeted a photo of a sign in one
   location reading, “Don’t be sour: We still have lemons, they’re just
   behind the counter now. Please ask if you need one.” Reddit users
   [25]also noticed that the lemons have gone missing.

   Chipotle didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment about the
   state of its lemons, so we rallied the troops at Quartz to investigate.
   Our cursory search confirmed that self-serve lemons were not available
   at Chipotles in Manhattan; Central Los Angeles; Lakewood, Texas; and
   Tyler, Texas. At the Chipotle in Lakewood, a Quartz reporter
   encountered another “don’t be sour” sign. Several of us were also told
   by Chipotle staffers that restaurants are no longer allowed to keep
   lemons out, and were then given a lemon wedge in a small plastic cup.

   As might be expected, [26]some people on the Internet [27]are upset. To
   quote one [28]Twitter user, “chipotle giveth the lemon slices … and
   then taketh away.”

   Ok, maybe it’s a little less convenient, but when it comes to food
   safety, restricting access to lemons is also pretty reasonable. Several
   studies [29]have found that the lemon slices restaurants put in water
   can carry significant amounts of bacteria. In theory, that’s due to
   workers who don’t wash their hands properly before grabbing one for
   your cup. So you can only imagine how gross the bin of lemons that
   Chipotle used to leave out for anyone to stick their grubby fingers
   into probably got.
