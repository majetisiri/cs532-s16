jernfrost comments on “Tesla’s Model X Was a Mistake”

   By jernfrost

   I think people greatly exaggerate how easy it is to catch up to Tesla
   for an established player. GM, Ford, BMW, Mercedes might have 100 years
   of deep knowledge in ICE engine design an manufacture. But that
   knowledge is worth nothing with an electric car which is completely
   different. Tesla is the company with the longest experience here. Not
   only that but they changed the fundamentals about how you build a car.
   They make most stuff in house and have very quick turn over times. They
   can do tweaks in 5 minutes which the competitors require a month to
   change due to the reliance large number of external suppliers. The
   competition is weighted down by legacy requirements. They need to build
   common platforms which can be used for both their ICE and electric
   cars. Tesla has no such concerns to worry about.

   Tesla has a simple streamlined operation: They do almost everything in
   house and they only have to focus on electric cars. No other
   distractions.

   They also have a sort of hidden weapon in the form of SpaceX. They have
   higher expertise than any other car maker on working aluminum from
   reusing the knowledge gained from SpaceX. Elon Musk can trickle down a
   lot of know how from his SpaceX operation. Most car companies are not
   using synergies from spaceship companies :-D

   Under the mathematical system of Y Combinator, that time and date may

   best/worst year at University.
