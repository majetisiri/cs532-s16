Welsh home installs UK's first Tesla Powerwall storage battery

   Battery could revolutionise UK energy market by enabling people to
   store excess energy generated from rooftop solar panels

   The setting is decidedly modest: a utility room in a red-brick house at
   the end of a cul-de-sac in Wales. But if [51]the hype turns out to be
   right, this may be the starting point for an energy revolution in the
   UK.

   Householder Mark Kerr has become the first British owner of a [52]Tesla
   Powerwall, a cutting-edge bit of kit that the makers say will provide a
   “[53]missing link” in solar energy.

   Like many owners of solar panels, Kerr and his family have a basic
   problem. They tend to be out at work and school when the sun is shining
   and the 16 solar panels on the roof of their home in Cardiff are
   producing power.

   The excess they miss out on is fed into the grid and they make a return
   on it but it does not seem right that they do not get to use the power
   from their panels.

   infrastructure?

   However, from now, energy produced but not used during the day will
   charge the Powerwall and can then be used to provide them with the
   energy they need when they’re at home and their lights, music centres,
   computers, televisions and myriad other devices need feeding.

   A self-confessed tech-head and an electrician by trade, Kerr could
   hardly contain his excitement when the Powerwall arrived. “This is the
   future, definitely,” he said. “For me this is the logical next step. We
   have the solar panels but we need a way to make best use of the power
   they produce.”

   “Me and my family are all out in the day, and we are not making use of
   the enormous amount of clean energy that our solar panels produce. The
   battery will allow us to store the energy we don’t use in the day to
   use when we need it in the evenings.”

   There are other battery systems on the market, but since[55] its launch
   in California last year by Tesla’s billionaire founder, Elon Musk, the
   Powerwall has gathered something of a cult following.

   Kerr is clearly a disciple: “It’s a gorgeous-looking piece of
   technology, its design is very sleek and minimalistic and something you
   can hang on the wall like a piece of art, definitely nothing like some
   of the other clunky looking batteries.” If Kerr’s partner, Lyndsey,
   finds him missing one evening, it sounds like she may find him gazing
   at his new gizmo.

   There is a growing school of thought that [60]2016 could be the year of
   energy storage. At one end of the scale are large schemes – such as
   [61]Highview Power Storage project, due to start generating power next
   month by turning air to liquid and back again, driving a turbine in the
   process. At the other end of the scale is Kerr’s utility room.

   The 7kWh Powerwall is a lithium-ion-battery system invented by the
   company that has popularised electric sports cars. Not one to underplay
   his products, Tesla CEO Musk heralded the battery as “[62]a fundamental
   transformation [in] how energy is delivered across the Earth”.

   Related: [63]From liquid air to supercapacitors, energy storage is
   finally poised for a breakthrough

   A company called [64]Solar Plants, based in Port Talbot, south Wales,
   has installed Kerr’s Powerwall. Its managing director, Oliver Farr,
   said it had e-mailed 3,000 customers about the device. Of the 1,500 who
   opened the e-mail, 600 said they wanted one. “There is a lifestyle
   element to it,” said Farr. “It’s like people who have an iPhone wanting
   an Apple Watch.”

   Kerr’s is a freebie. Farr said he wanted to check how it worked before
   he sold it to other customers. He is not putting a price on it yet
   either. At the launch event, Musk said it cost $3,500. But this does
   not take into account the cost of the switchgear needed to make it
   work, and installation costs. Some experts both in the [65]UK and
   [66]Australia have suggested it could be more than a decade - the
   length of warranty - before the Powerwall pays for itself.

   The number-crunchers will not put Kerr off. He believes that his solar
   panels have already reduced his electricity bills by 20% and thinks the
   addition of the Powerwall might lead to a total reduction of 80%. “But
   it’s not just about the money. We’re environmentally minded and this
   seems the right thing to do.”
