   Chipotle says criminal investigation widens, sales plunge Associated
   Press Tuesday, February 2, 2016
   CANDICE CHOI
   NEW YORK (AP) â€” The E. coli outbreak that was linked to Chipotle
   restaurants may be over, but the burrito chain's indigestion continues.
   As Chipotle reported continuing sales declines on Tuesday, the
   embattled chain also said the scope of a previously disclosed federal
   criminal investigation has widened beyond a single restaurant in
   California.
   The Denver company says sales sank 36 percent at established locations
   in January. That follows a previously reported drop of 14.6 percent for
   the October-to-December period, which marked the first quarterly
   decline since Chipotle went public a decade ago.
   Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. also said it has been served with another
   subpoena requiring it produce documents related to company-wide food
   safety dating back to the start of 2013. Previously, it had said it was
   served a subpoena in relation to a California restaurant, where there
   was a norovirus outbreak over the summer.
   Montgomery Moran, co-CEO of Chipotle, said he believed investigators
   wanted to make sure "everything we did was on the up and up." He also
   said he thinks that will be the ultimate conclusion at the end of the
   case.
   A representative for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central
   District of California, which is conducting the investigation with the
   Food and Drug Administration, declined to comment.
   Chipotle has been reeling since an E. coli outbreak linked to its
   restaurants came to light at the end of October. The outbreak sickened
   people in 11 states. Then in December, a norovirus outbreak at a Boston
   location heightened customer fears about the safety of the chain's
   food. Sales at established locations dropped 30 percent that month.
   Now, Chipotle is pushing to move past its troubles and win back
   customers. The company has announced a series of new food safety
   measures, such as blanching onions before chopping them and stepped up
   testing of ingredients. And this week, it noted that the Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention declared the E. coli outbreak to be
   over.
   Co-CEO Steve Ellse said Tuesday the company was "pleased to have this
   behind us."
   As such, Chipotle executives said they plan to launch the company's
   biggest marketing effort ever next week. It will encompass outdoor,
   print and radio advertising.
   On Monday, the company also plans to open stores at 3 p.m., rather than
   the usual 11 a.m., so workers can participate in a company-wide meeting
   on food safety.
   For the period ending Dec. 31, Chipotle opened 79 new restaurants,
   bringing its total to 2,010 locations. The new locations helped make up
   for the sales declines at existing locations.
   Total revenue fell 7 percent to $997.5 million in the period. Analysts
   expected $1.01 billion, according to FactSet.
   Profit fell 44 percent to $67.9 million, or $2.17 per share. Analysts
   expected $1.86 per share.
   Shares of Chipotle fell 8 percent to $436 in after-hours trading. The
   stock is down more than 30 percent since the end of October.
