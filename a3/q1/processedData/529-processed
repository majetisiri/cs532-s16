Chipotle launches food safety site, but ad campaign skirts the issue

   Chipotle Mexican Grill plans to launch a food safety website and the
   largest marketing and advertising campaign in the company’s history to
   lure back customers who became skittish after the chain’s recent
   foodborne illness outbreaks.

   “On Feb. 8, we are launching a new food safety website, which outlines
   all the steps we have taken in order to make our food as safe as it
   possibly can be,” Mark Crumpacker, Chipotle’s chief creative and
   development officer, said during a 2015 fourth quarter and year-end
   earnings conference call Feb. 2 between Chipotle’s top executives and
   primarily market analysts from some of the nation’s largest investment
   firms.

   Crumpacker also discussed the chain’s reported $50 million marketing
   and advertising campaign which does not focus on food safety or the
   recent E. coli and norovirus outbreaks that sickened more than 500
   people at restaurants across the country in the past six months.

   “Beginning next week, we are launching a variety of marketing programs
   designed to invite our customers back into our restaurants,” Crumpacker
   said during the conference call. “This effort includes a large,
   traditional advertising campaign that covers all of our major markets.
   … The campaign is the largest in company history and this current wave
   is scheduled to run from February through the end of June.

   “The creative for this campaign, with one small exception, does not
   mention food safety or the recent incidents,” he said. “Instead, it
   reinforces our commitment to high-quality ingredients and great-tasting
   food.”

   In one bit of bright news for Chipotle, the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention said Feb. 1 the E. coli outbreak linked to the burrito
   chain “appeared to be over.”

   Chipotle officers said the company has taken several steps to ensure
   its food is safe, from changing the way produce and other ingredients
   are prepared to stepped-up inspections of products before they are
   delivered to the chain’s restaurants.

   Chipotle plans not to open its 2,000 restaurants until 3 p.m. Feb. 8 to
   have a nationwide discussion about food safety with its employees.

   “What is most important is that we have implemented a comprehensive
   food safety plan, and now that the recent CDC investigation is behind
   us, we are confident that our aggressive marketing communication will
   help welcome lapsed and new customers into Chipotle,” Crumpacker said
   during the call.

   At this point, you really sound like a tabloid journalist. What does
   Chipotle even have to do with the produce industry?? It's 1 restaurant
   chain and all you've done for weeks is blast their name on your
   headlines. Couple that with the complete lack of evidence from the CDC
   investigation, and The Packer now resembles the National Enquirer. Give
   it up already. The people do not believe your hysteria and hype.
