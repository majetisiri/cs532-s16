There’s a new theory about the source of the Chipotle E. coli outbreak

       The source of Chipotle's E. coli outbreak might have been tainted
       Australian beef, according to a new report in [24]The Wall Street
       Journal.
       Citing unidentified sources, Julie Jargon and Jesse Newman report
       Chipotle has concluded that the Australian beef was the most likely
       cause.
       The report also highlights disagreements between the company and
       the Centers for Disease Control, which on Monday announced the end
       to the outbreak and said the source was never identified.
       When asked to confirm whether the company believed Australian beef
       was the source of the outbreak, Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold
       said:

     We are not going to comment on theories or speculation. The
     investigation has concluded and no ingredient was identified as the
     cause.
     I'd note that the same article highlights a few theories. In the
     Northwest, it notes that "local health authorities initially
     suspected locally sourced produce," according to Washington state
     epidemiologist Scott Lindquist. And it states that "government
     officials leaned toward produce."
     In the end, investigators were not able to determine a cause.
       Chipotle began importing beef from Australia two years ago because
       it couldn't find enough domestically raised grass-fed beef to meet
       growing demand, according to [25]Chipotle founder Steve Ells.
       "We recently began sourcing some steak from ranches in Southern
       Australia, which is among the very best places in the world for
       raising beef cattle entirely on grass," [26]Ells said in a 2014
       op-ed article. "The meat produced by these ranchers is 'grass-fed'
       in the truest sense of the term: The cattle spend their entire
       lives grazing on pastures or rangelands, eating only grass or
       forages (by definition, forages are hay and grass — corn is not
       forage)."
       The E. coli outbreak sickened more than 50 people in 11 states
       between October and December. A second, smaller outbreak linked to
       a different strain of E. coli sickened five people in three states
       in December.
       The company is making a [27]numerous changes to how it prepares and
       handles food to avoid another outbreak.
       For example, Chipotle is now marinating chopped onions, jalapenos,
       and cilantro in citrus juice when it makes salsas and guacamole.
       The company is also using a new procedure for marinating chicken
       and steak, "which now happens distinct from and after the
       preparation of other fresh items" in resealable plastic bags,
       rather than bowls.
