   As I wrote in my previous post , power utilities are pushing back
   against rooftop solar, but by doing so they are only accelerating the
   development of solar+storage, which may prove to be an even bigger
   threat. That's why solar+storage is spreading so fast in Germany and
   Japan — in addition to direct subsidies for storage, tariffs for solar
   energy have fallen below retail prices, opening the opportunity for
   arbitrage. That can help the utility smooth out fluctuations and spikes
   in demand and ease grid congestion, reducing the need for peaker plants
   and power lines. On this subject, I recommend two posts from energy
   analyst Ramez Naam, who has done yeoman's work pulling together the
   latest data and expert opinions. And under the high-end, optimistic
   scenario RMI modeled, the moment of "grid parity" is pushed decades
   earlier — New York and California by 2020, even Kentucky and Texas by
   2030.
