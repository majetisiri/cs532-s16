The Chipotle Effect: When Companies Believe Their Own Hype

   Earlier this week the federal Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention finally [12]closed the books on the investigation of the E.
   coli outbreaks at multiple Chipotle locations last December. The news
   of dozens (at one point thought to be hundreds) of customers getting
   sick made headlines nationwide and drove the burrito purveyor into a
   frenzy of apologies and promises of improved safety.

   Other than telling us that people have stopped getting sick, though,
   the government investigators [13]don’t seem to be providing us with
   much information on what caused the outbreaks. Chipotle CEO Steve Ells
   [14]attempted to reassure customers and investors alike at a recent
   conference, saying that due to the company’s increased emphasis on food
   safety, the risk of another infectious outbreak was “near zero.”

   Whether it was the carnitas or the cilantro-lime rice, though, there’s
   good reason to think that it could happen again. The problem with
   Chipotle is much bigger than rules about which head of lettuce is
   washed in which sink. It’s about what happens when corporate marketing
   becomes more important that the product itself, and it can only be
   fixed by understanding what a company like Chipotle exists to
   accomplish in the first place.

   Instead of focusing on actual food quality, the company seems to have
   been distracted by lifestyle trends and politically popular marketing
   gimmicks. Last April, the company announced that it had fully
   eliminated from its menu any ingredients that had been improved with
   genetic engineering. Despite agreement among food safety experts that
   genetically modified foods face no novel health risks, Chipotle
   invested a large amount of time and effort attempting to eliminate all
   GM ingredients from their operations. By September, however, the
   company’s lawyers [15]were responding to a lawsuit alleging that they
   had failed, and had misled customers with their claim.

   On the flip side, the company has also famously been unable to obtain
   steady supplies of some of the ingredients that do meet their
   requirements, like [16]non-conventionally raised pork. They even warned
   investors in 2014 that the effects of global climate change might cause
   them to [17]stop serving guacamole, although the [18]Washington Post
   quickly responded by [19]reassuring readers that “Chipotle’s guacamole
   isn’t going anywhere (for now).”

   All of this puts additional burdens on the employees who are just
   trying to make sure that customers get adequately served. First, the
   more specific a corporate buyer’s requirements, the more brittle the
   supply chain becomes. A lot of suppliers will be able to sell you
   romaine lettuce and pork shoulder, but if you can only use lettuce that
   is locally grown and organic and pork that meets a laundry list of
   sustainability requirements, that can lead to a series of cascading
   shortages and delays if operations at any of those suppliers slow down.

   The second concern is one of management focus. If the message filtering
   through the company grapevine is that “sustainable initiatives” and PR
   opportunities with environmental groups are the most important aspects
   of corporate culture, those are going to be the top priorities for
   every aspiring senior manager in the company. The more attention that
   is lavished on non-core tasks, the fewer eyeballs there are going to be
   watching out for the non-glamorous but far more important goals of food
   quality and sanitation. Who wants to stay at home filling out reports
   on soil microbes when the rest of the executive team is expensing [20]a
   trip to Switzerland to dazzle a conference of fellow business leaders?

   The final burden is the problem of a CEO who doesn’t seem to be 100%
   behind his own product. Corporate America is full of leaders who seem
   to spend more time rehearsing their TED talks than studying quarterly
   reports, but at least they are generally passionate promoters of their
   own products. Steve Ells, Chipotle’s founder and co-CEO, has often
   given off the aura of a corporate titan who is vaguely embarrassed to
   be in business at all.

   Ells, a Culinary Institute of America graduate, originally aspired to a
   career in fine dining. As food writer Julie Gunlock [21]recently mused,
   Ells comes off “like an art school graduate who takes a desk job to pay
   the bills” and regrets “scarring America’s landscape with yet another
   massive fast food franchise.” Hardly the profile of a confident
   corporate leader. If it is true, as he told the Huffington Post, that
   over the years he “felt a little guilty” every time another Chipotle
   opened, it is perhaps no surprise that the company has attempted to
   locate its moral center in everything but the humble practice of
   selling good food at a reasonable price.

   In fairness, there is nothing necessarily wrong with a marketing
   strategy that includes fluff or caters to trendy consumer obsessions–if
   you deliver what you promise. To the extent that Chipotle’s corporate
   culture has caused it to ignore critical operations, however, it has
   wandered into dangerous territory indeed.
