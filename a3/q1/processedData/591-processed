Tesla's Powerwall to flow batteries: a guide to the energy storage revolution

   From Tesla’s Powerwall to flow batteries, we look at existing and
   emerging technology that could be a critical part of the sustainable
   energy puzzle

   Batteries – the workhorse technology that injects life into gadgets we
   can’t live without – are taking on a bigger role as they replace petrol
   tanks in cars and make their way into homes and businesses to store
   electricity from rooftop solar panels or the grid.

   tech trends to watch

   Developments in battery technology may not be a popular dinner party
   topic yet but that could change. The unveiling of Tesla’s low-cost home
   battery pack, the [53]Powerwall, back in May helped raise public
   awareness of a field that is booming with innovation and billions of
   dollars of global investment.

   The US energy storage market is growing particularly fast, and
   batteries are the star players. The country installed [54]40.7
   megawatts of energy storage projects in homes, businesses and utilities
   in the second quarter of this year, nine times more than the same
   quarter last year.

   Worldwide the total amount of energy storage, discounting the electric
   car market, could reach [55]240 gigawatts by 2030 , according to a
   report by Citigroup, with batteries as the dominant technology.

   Here is our handy guide for understanding existing and emerging battery
   technology:

1. What are the most common types of batteries?

   Alkaline, lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries are the most commonly
   used. Single-use batteries such as the alkaline AA or AAA power
   flashlights and remote controls. Electric cars and grid energy storage,
   however, use rechargeable batteries such as lead-acid and lithium-ion.
   Lead-acid batteries are relatively cheap but typically last only a few
   years and aren’t powerful enough to be the sole source of energy for a
   car. They also have toxic elements that require special handling after
   use.

2. The rise of lithium-ion batteries

   Hitting the market in the 90s, lithium-ion batteries generally pack
   more energy into a given volume, last longer and operate at a wider
   range of temperatures than other rechargeable batteries.

   As a result, they’ve become the standard batteries for running
   computers, mobile phones and other consumer electronics. They also have
   the energy density and longevity that make them suitable for powering
   cars and storing and dispatching solar electricity.

   Lithium-ion batteries are winning the race so far in the electric car
   and grid energy storage markets. Their popularity in powering consumer
   electronics such as laptops and mobile phones gives them a natural lead
   over newer types of batteries.

   Tesla is using Panasonic’s lithium-ion batteries for its cars and is
   building a giant [56]$5bn battery factory in Nevada to meet anticipated
   demand for cars and the grid energy storage systems.

   “It’s fairly obvious that lithium-ion batteries will be the solution
   for at least the next five to 10 years,” says Haresh Kamath, program
   manager for energy storage at the Electrical Power Research Institute,
   a nonprofit research group serving the utility industry. “So many
   people are making [them], so there’s good competition in terms of
   prices. We know how to use [them], so there are not a lot of risks.”

3. What do lithium-ion batteries cost?

   They aren’t cheap. A battery pack to power a car or store solar
   electricity requires many more lithium-ion cells than a laptop or
   mobile phone. Those costs add up and explain why an electric car tends
   to be more expensive than its petrol counterpart.

   Then there are the additional costs of designing and building battery
   packs, as well as the electronics and software to monitor battery
   performance and ensure it operates optimally.

   Battery prices are falling as more manufacturers build more factories
   to meet anticipated demand in the electric car and grid energy storage
   market. Five years ago, a lithium-ion battery would fetch over $1,000
   per kilowatt-hour in wholesale price. Now the average price hovers
   around $300-$400 per kilowatt hour (lead-acid batteries, which don’t
   last as long and can’t hold as much energy, generally cost $100-$200
   per kilowatt hour).

   [60]Tesla plans to charge $250 per kilowatt hour for the batteries in
   the large system it has designed for business and utility customers and
   $500 per kilowatt hour for a system that includes the electronics and
   software to operate it. The company expects to lower that system price
   to $300 per kilowatt hour when its new battery factory runs at full
   capacity by 2020.

4. Are lithium-ion batteries as good as they get?

   Research has been done to improve lithium-ion batteries’ performance,
   such as energy density, longevity and production costs. One
   Massachusetts battery developer, 24M, claims to be “reinventing the
   lithium-ion battery”.

   The company has been able to push up the energy density by 15-20% in
   cells it produced on a pilot production line while also cutting
   manufacturing costs, according to Yet-Ming Chiang, co-founder and chief
   scientist of the company and an MIT professor. 24M’s redesign of the
   battery aims to eliminate 80% of non-energy storing material, reducing
   the number of production steps and creating a more streamlined process.
   Chiang plans to bring the technology to market in late 2017.

5. Where next for battery technology?

   Flow batteries are serious contenders to compete with lithium-ion
   batteries. These store electricity in two tanks of liquid separated by
   a membrane.

   The bigger the tanks in the flow batteries, the more energy can be
   stored. This makes it very easy to increase the energy density, meaning
   flow batteries are attractive for storing a large amount of energy over
   long duration. But it also makes them much bulkier than a lithium-ion
   battery.

   looks like

   Primus Power has developed a flow battery that is quite different from
   conventional designs. It uses one tank instead of two for holding the
   energy storing materials. It also uses titanium instead of plastic for
   its electrodes, which helps to boost energy production, says Tom
   Stepien, Primus’s CEO. The company has just raised $25m and won a major
   contract to deliver its batteries to the biggest electricity provider
   in Kazakhstan, Samruk-Energy.

   Meanwhile, research is underway to replace the common energy storing
   materials for flow batteries (vanadium, iron, zinc and bromine) with
   cheaper and less toxic versions.

   A team of Harvard University researchers is working on a [62]battery
   made of non-toxic organic materials which promises to perform as well
   as vanadium while costing less, says Michael Aziz, an engineering
   professor at Harvard and leader of this research. The battery, which
   will be billed as environmentally-friendly and non-corrosive, will be
   aimed at homes and businesses.
