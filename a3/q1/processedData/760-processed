Black Beans & Coconut Rice Recipe | How to Make Cuban Beans & Rice. Here is
what you need: 1 c. sweetened flaked coconut 1 cup rice 3 1/2-4 cups
vegetable broth, divided 1/4 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper 4 Tbsp. butter,
divided (or olive oil, for vegan version) 1/2 large onion, chopped 2 15 oz
cans black beans, drained and rinsed 2 tsp. chili powder 1/4 tsp. cayenne
pepper (skip if desired) 1 lime 3 green onions, sliced approximately 3/4 c.
chopped fresh cilantro (I usually use 1 whole bunch) sour cream (optional)
easy mango salsa 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread out coconut on baking
sheet and bake until toasted, 5-10 minutes. 2. Bring 2 1/2 cups of the broth,
salt, pepper, and 2 Tbsp. butter to a boil in large saucepan. Stir in rice.
Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook about 20 minutes until water is absorbed.
3. Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 Tbsp. butter in a large skillet over
medium-high heat. Saute onions 5-7 minutes, or until tender. Stir in black
beans, spices, and 1 cup of broth. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring
occasionally, 15 minutes. If bean mixture begins to look too dry, add a
little more broth. 4. Roll the lime around on the counter, pressing down with
your palm as you roll to loosen the juices. Remove rice from heat. Cut lime
in half, then squeeze in juice from both halves. Stir in toasted coconut and
cilantro. 5. To serve, spoon rice onto plate. Top with beans, and then
garnish with sour cream and salsa.
