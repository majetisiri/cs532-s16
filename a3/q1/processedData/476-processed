If Chipotle (and Public Health) were transparent in July 2015, could all of
Chipotle’s woes been avoided?

   Yesterday, with the announcement of an expanded criminal investigation
   and slumping sales, combined with a stock price creeping slightly back
   up from the bottom after a multi-billion dollar free fall, it does make
   you wonder if Chipotle could have turned its bus around before it drove
   off this cliff?

   Now it could be facing criminal charges, a stockholder’s lawsuit, and
   the lawsuits and probable lawsuits in multiple states from the nearly
   500 customers from six foodborne illness outbreak in the last several
   months.  As I said to the [18]Oregonian back in early November:

   Chipotle has had three known outbreaks this year [norovirus outbreak in
   Simi Valley that sickened 234, Salmonella outbreak in Minnesota that
   sickened 64 and an E. coli O26 outbreak that has of late sickened 55],
   including the most recent one in Oregon and Washington. But there was
   also a fourth in Seattle [in July 2015] that put two people [sickened
   5] in the hospital.  [And, then there was the Boston norovirus outbreak
   in December]

   Health officials, who investigated the [July E. coli O157:H7] outbreak,
   did not inform the public.

   “I find that completely, unequivocally wrong,” said Bill Marler, a food
   safety litigator in Seattle. “They have a responsibility to the
   public.”

   Public health officials in Seattle said that by the time they figured
   out that Chipotle was responsible, the outbreak had ended.

   “It took us a while to make the connection between the sick people and
   Chipotle,” James Apa, spokesman for Public Health – Seattle & King
   County, said in an email. “By the time we were able to make an
   association with Chipotle, the outbreak was over.”

   And, the Oregonian story was before the announcement of yet another E.
   coli O26 outbreak that sickened 5 and a Boston norovirus outbreak that
   sickened 140.

   You have to wonder if public health – and Chipotle – had made an
   announcement in July that people were sickened in Seattle (at the store
   where my college-aged daughters used to be customers), if Chipotle
   would have found its new-found interest in safer food before more
   people were sickened, its stock price sank, the U.S. Attorneys arrived
   with subpoeans, and the stockholders and customers began filing
   lawsuits?  My strong feeling is that they both wish that they had been
   more transparent and not covered-up information from the public that it
   clearly has a right to know.  Failing to disclose undercut public
   health’s credibility and gave cover to Chipotle to continue to ignore
   its lack of interest if safer food.

   Here are some of the details of the July outbreak that we received from
   the Washington State Department of Health:

   In early August 2015, Public Health Seattle King County (PHSKC)
   investigated an outbreak of E. coli O157 that occurred among five
   patrons of Chipotle Mexican Grill located at 1415 Broadway in Seattle,
   Washington. Illness onset dates occurred on July 28, 2015 (1 case),
   July 29 (2 cases) and July 31 (2 cases). All five cases reported
   experiencing diarrhea that turned bloody and abdominal cramps. Two
   cases reported vomiting. Two cases reported fever. Three cases were
   hospitalized. Two sought treatment at an emergency department. None of
   the patients developed HUS. There were no deaths.

   The Washington Department of Health Public Health Laboratory conducted
   genetic testing by PFGE on isolates cultured from patients’ specimens.
    Test results showed that all were infected with an indistinguishable
   genetic strain assigned PulseNet Identification Numbers
   EXHX01.0012/EXHA26.1779. This strain had not been seen previously in
   King County.

   Ill customers reported eating different menu items. But common
   ingredients included cilantro lime rice, pico de gallo, beans,
   guacamole, and corn. PHSKC environmental specialists conducted an
   onsite field investigation. No critical violations were observed. All
   ten employees submitted stool specimens for testing. And all were
   negative for enteric pathogens. The outbreak was reported to the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a brief summary report
   was prepared. [19]See Washington Department of Health general outbreak
   records.

   My guess is that if Chipotle took the hit in July for sickening 5 and
   implemented the food safety changes it is now doing two norovirus, one
   Salmonella and two other E. coli outbreaks could have been avoided.
