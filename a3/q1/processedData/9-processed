Minoring in Twitter: Players rejoice in Chipotle’s good news; Trevor Gretzky
on the road and a Minor Leaguer’s monkey

   By Danny Wild / MiLB.com

   Good news if you’re a Minor Leaguer — the E. coli outbreak that has
   plagued America and Danny Ainge’s favorite Mexican restaurant is over,
   according to the CDC:

     Just announced that the E.coli outbreak at [13]@ChipotleTweets is
     now over!! What a time to be alive

     — Jared Wilson (@JaredDWilson) [14]February 1, 2016

     Looks like the [15]@MiLB diet is back on. Heard [16]@ChipotleTweets
     if safe to eat at again 🙌🏼

     — Chipper Smith (@Chipper_Smith3) [17]February 1, 2016

   Yankees prospect [18]Gosuke Katoh was completely undeterred by the E.
   coli fears, claiming he stopped by for dozens of burritos:

     Filing my taxes today and realized I went to Chipotle at least 80
     times in 6 months [19]#survivedecoli

     — Gosuke Katoh (加藤豪将) (@GosukeKatoh) [20]February 1, 2016

   If my math is correct, Gosuke was averaging about three Chipotle trips
   per week.

   Cubs left-hander [21]Rob Zastryzny (go ahead, pronounce that in your
   head) said he would pay someone to follow his Twitter account with
   Chipotle:

     [22]@ElEsteban09 a chipotle burrito, no guac.

   There’s no better feeling than sleeping on clean sheets, says Blue Jays
   prospect [24]Jeremy Gabryszwski. What about going to sleep — even on
   dirty sheets — and knowing you don’t have to set an alarm and can sleep
   in? What about that feeling you get when you first bite into a slice of
   crispy, cheesy pizza? What about waking up on those dirty sheets,
   thinking you have to get up for work/school and then realizing nope,
   it’s Saturday?

     No better feeling then going to sleep on clean sheets!!

     — Jeremy gabryszwski (@gabryszwski21) [25]February 1, 2016

   What about that feeling when you dig into a nice cold chocolate frosty?

     Frostys make the world go round

   The Binghamton Mets would like to warm up the night for fans on April
   12 with this promotion (to which they provided zero details):

     That's right. The [27]#BMets invite you to [28]#chill with us on a
     cold April night while appreciating [29]#Netflix Originals!

     On a cold night in Binghamton is there anything better to do than

   Valentine’s Day is approaching (no need to remind me, honestly) and our
   own Ben Hill is sharing his love for the Carolina League:

     I love you too. [36]https://t.co/orlOPpiOXS

   What’s more annoying than getting an egg shell in your scrambled eggs?
   Maybe hearing Sarah Palin’s voice?

     Very few things test my patience the way a rogue egg shell does when
     it falls into the bowl as I'm trying to make scrambled eggs

   Couldn’t find a single player who tweeted about the Iowa Caucus on
   Monday, but there was this:

     I don't usually do politics, but I have to ask: Has anyone ever seen
     Ted Cruz and Tom Ricketts in the same place?

     [42]@b__l__p see and I think this part is the creepiest:

   For those who watched the Iowa coverage — where people wrote candidate
   names on scrap paper and dropped them into popcorn buckets — you may
   have noticed an MiLB angle. At least one district was using Iowa Cubs
   buckets to collect votes:

     First-in-the-nation caucuses. Ballots in buckets. Iowa Cubs buckets.
     [45]#iacaucus [46]pic.twitter.com/eMFyq6ORQx

   The D-backs released 2014 27th-round pick Nate Robertson in October,
   and you’re probably wondering a couple things: will he latch on with a
   new team for Spring Training, and what’s the status of his stuffed
   peppers recipe?

     Safe to say that stuffed peppers are still a working progress!!

     — Nate Robertson (@Yeahhyeah11) [53]February 4, 2016

   Apparently when a gigantic tornado rolls through Texas, no one really
   stops playing baseball/runs from the ballpark:

   A Minor Leaguer cradling a monkey in the clubhouse? Sure, why not?

     Throwback to that day we had to hide all the bananas in the
     clubhouse. [59]pic.twitter.com/peBt2jsR35

   Memphis right-hander Deck McGuire says this mobile gaming station was
   “best $350 I’ve ever spent”:

   Rays righty Kyle McKenzie says what you’re all thinking: putting on
   ChapStick just doesn’t feel macho:

     There is no manly way to apply Chapstick

     — kyle mckenzie (@kmckenzie13) [69]February 3, 2016

   Is there a manly way to bake a cake, though?

     Recap of my day

     -Woke up, bored
     – Said dude lets bake a cake
     -went to store
     -came home and made cake

     That is a phenomenal day right there

     — kyle mckenzie (@kmckenzie13) [70]January 15, 2016

   McKenzie also has some thoughts on the right and wrong way to apply
   milk to your bowl of cereal — careful, or he’ll call the authorities:

     If u put the milk in the bowl before the cereal u are an absolute
     psycho and u deserve to be put in prison

     — kyle mckenzie (@kmckenzie13) [71]January 19, 2016

   That will be the next great Netflix docudrama — society’s efforts to
   free an imprisoned man convicted of filling his bowl with milk before
   his Frosted Flakes.

   Of course I’m a [72]Trevor Gretzky fan, but he’s been a little inactive
   on Twitter lately. In that case, we turn to Instagram, where he’s
   posing next to his family’s jet:

   People here at MiLB.com make fun of me for putting CNN on the TV. But I
   need my daily Donald Trump entertainmen:

     It is sad how much I watch CNN.

   Pirates prospect Jameson Taillon can taste Spring Training. Mmmmm.

     my hands lol
