Squash/zuccini fritters-- this is just the way I came up with these...tweek
the "recipe", as I have, to suit taste. Buttermilk is ALWAYS best. Grate up
squash or squash and zuccini into a bowl. You'll need at least a cup of it
grated. Sometimes, I'll grate up some onion as well...just a touch for taste.
Salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar. Fry up on griddle.
