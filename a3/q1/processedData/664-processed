   A furious car owner vented his anger when he came back with a date to
   find someone had left excrement on his brand new vehicle.

   The man posted a lengthy warning note on Craigslist complaining of his
   harrowing episode in Chicago.

   He was walking back to his shiny Tesla Model X, an electric-powered
   'sports utility vehicle' which cost from around $80,000, when the
   incident happened.
   Michael's angry letter which he posted on Craigslist - in it he says he
   would offer a financial reward to anyone who comes forward with
   information

   incident with the Tesla car happened

   In the post he said: 'I was on a date with a girl, who was very
   conservative. It was our third date and when we walked out, sure enough
   we saw that someone had taken a very large s**t on my
   windshield...leading me to believe that perhaps someone had s**t in a
   container at home and then threw it on my car later.'

   Michael said his date was 'really traumatized' and claimed police
   officers 'absolutely refused' to help him.

   The 36-year-old added: 'I had to use a redeye magazine and a bottle of
   water to clean it off and that sucked.'

   Michael has now started his own investigation and is looking for 'solid
   intelligence' into the incident.

   He has even kept a sample of the excrement as he fears his car may be
   targeted again.

   '...I will plan on ruling you out with DNA for I have kept a sample of
   the s**t for I can see someone trying to pull another fast one on me,'
   he added.

   'And trust me, that is not going to happen. Taking dumps on a person's
   car is something children do, not adults. And although from time to
   time, I could see why someone deserves it, this was absolutely uncalled
   for.'

   Michael is offering 'significant compensation' to anyone who helps
   conclude his case although he has yet to publish a reward figure.

   His final paragraph of anger begins: 'Lastly, a message to the person
   who did this: I will find you. Do you understand me? I have already had
   my lawyer draft up subpoena to acquire footage from
   nearby security cameras amongst other things.

   'Personally, I think you need medical attention to do what you have
   done.'
