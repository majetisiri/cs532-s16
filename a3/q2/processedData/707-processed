Of Course There Are Chipotle Truthers. There Were Always Going to Be Chipotle
Truthers

   Chipotle E. Coli Outbreak Expands To Nine U.S. States (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   The controversy over GMOs, Chipotle, and Chipotle’s [30]apparent
   inability to not repeatedly sicken its consumers is utterly
   fascinating. It should be a case study in every political-psychology
   textbook, because it has allowed us to watch, in real time, as an issue
   gets intensely politicized and, in turn, becomes a focal point for all
   sorts of addled thinking and wild conspiracies.

   Let me back up for one minute, because I don’t want to imply that
   there’s always a clean or straightforward distinction between
   “objective” and “politicized” thinking. But to the folks who study
   these questions for a living, there are important gradations. When I
   [31]wrote about anti-vaccination ideologies a year ago, for example, a
   couple of experts highlighted to me the fact that anti-vaxxers don’t
   sort cleanly along political lines, and that the worst thing that could
   happen would be for it to start to become a political issue. Once we
   start to think some belief isn’t just correct but is the sort of thing
   people like me believe, it becomes more personal, more visceral, and
   tougher to dislodge. If tomorrow anti-vax ideology became a key
   component of membership in some influential political group, that would
   be very bad public-health news.

   To illustrate this principle a bit further, take an extreme and
   unlikely example: Assuming you know how to count, if someone puts a
   small bag of M&Ms in front of you and asks you to write the number of
   M&Ms in there on a piece of paper, nothing in your brain will bias you
   away from the right answer: You just count the M&Ms and, assuming you
   aren’t distracted by all that tasty chocolate, arrive at the correct
   number. But let’s say you’re a hard-line member of a small religious
   sect that views odd numbers as evil — stating them aloud or writing
   them can actually get you kicked out of the community entirely. Then
   you’re at a disadvantage: You have a 50 percent chance of flubbing what
   should have been a basic task, because if you arrived at an odd count,
   you’d have to add or subtract an M&M since people like you just don’t
   write odd numbers — this is an important part of who you are, and the
   fact that there are an even number of M&Ms is secondary.

   Back to Chipotle: When the burrito giant announced last year that it
   was (sort of) getting rid of GMOs, it won widespread acclaim from bien
   pensant environment- and health-focused progressives. Some people,
   [32]myself included, pointed out that these plaudits were unearned;
   given the lack of a substantive scientific or environmental case
   against GMOs (as opposed to certain situations in which they could be
   used harmfully or improperly, just as traditional agriculture methods
   can be), this was a bullshit PR move aimed at draping the company in a
   cloak of good corporate citizenship, especially in light of all the
   ways eating Chipotle — or eating certain things there at least — is
   legitimately bad for you. Naturally, Science of Us and other outlets
   [33]making these sorts of arguments were tarred in various comment
   sections and blog posts as “pro-Monsanto” and so forth, since to the
   people celebrating Chipotle’s move it was inconceivable that anyone
   criticizing that move isn’t in the pocket of their sworn agribusiness
   enemies (one line of anti-GMO argument is "big agribusiness companies
   use GMOs, big agribusiness companies are bad, and therefore GMOs are
   bad" — though this ignores the fact that in some contexts, GMOs help
   out small farmers a great deal).

   [34]Chipotle’s Anti-GMO Stance Didn’t Keep Its Customers Safe
   [35]Chipotle Is Promoting Opportunistic Anti-Science Hysteria

   Since the announcement, Chipotle has grappled with health emergency
   after health emergency, all around the country: Many of its customers
   [36]have been sickened with norovirus, salmonella, and E. coli.
   Obviously, it would have been preferable for no one to get sick, but
   these incidents did highlight, in a grim way, the difference between
   superficial corporate virtue-signalling and actually, you know, making
   sure your product is safe for your customers.

   So how does the anti-GMO crowd interpret all of this? Yesterday, Uproxx
   [37]highlighted a [38]late December “analysis” article in [39]Natural
   News by “Mike Adams, the Health Ranger,” which offers up a rather
   shocking storyline:

     After observing recent events involving Chipotle and e.coli, here's
     my analysis of the situation: Chipotle's e.coli outbreaks are not
     random chance. They are the result of the biotech industry
     bioterrorism attacks against [40]the only fast food company that has
     publicly denounced GMOs.

     How do we know? The CDC has already admitted that some of these
     e.coli outbreaks involve a "rare genetic strain" of e.coli not
     normally seen in foods. Furthermore, we also know the track record
     of the biotech industry engaging in the most criminal, dirty,
     sleazebag tactics imaginable against any person or company that
     speaks out against GMOs.

     Doctor Oz, for example, was maliciously targeted in a defamation
     campaign funded by the biotech industry earlier this year. The
     onslaught against Oz was initiated because he publicly expressed his
     support for honest GMO labeling on foods.

     …

     There is absolutely no question that the biotech industry will
     resort to ANY activity necessary to destroy food companies that
     oppose GMOs. And yes, this includes acts of bioterrorism against
     Chipotle -- something that's ridiculously easy for biotech industry
     operatives to carry out with simple, low-cost laboratory supplies
     sold online at places like Amazon.com.

     In my [41]HealthRangerReport.com podcast, shown below, I am now
     openly encouraging Chipotle's management to initiate a criminal
     investigation with the FBI to attempt to identify the sources of
     this corporate sabotage campaign.

     To be clear, what's really happening at Chipotle is that biotech
     industry shills are deliberately contaminating Chipotle's food with
     strains of e.coli in a malicious attempt to destroy both the
     reputation and finances of the Chipotle food chain. This act of
     bioterrorism is entirely consistent with the known behavior patterns
     of the biotech industry which, for example, engaged in [42]illegal
     money laundering in Washington state in order to destroy the GMO
     labeling bill there. [formatting his]

   You got that? The biotech companies are so threatened by Chipotle brave
   stance that they are sticking it to the company by contaminating its
   customers’ food.

   No actual evidence is provided of this astounding claim, nor are any of
   the perpetrators named, but no matter: This article has been shared one
   hundred and twenty thousand times on Facebook. This is how a
   not-insignificant chunk of people interprets Chipotle sickening its
   customers: as evidence of a conspiracy against Chipotle.

   It is bizarre to see the anti-corporate granola crowd lining up to
   defend the integrity of a corporate behemoth like Chipotle, but there
   you have it. This is what happens when a given debate becomes so
   politicized, so tightly wound up in people’s political identities, that
   common sense and objectivity get tossed into the garbage like a day-old
   burrito.

   In all likelihood, the truth of these health incidents is a lot less
   spectacular: The investigations, some of which are [43]already under
   way, are probably going to reveal some level of cost-cutting or
   sloppiness or miscommunication or corruption — not a heart-stopping
   conspiracy. To the un-addled, the evidence will be straightforward, the
   conclusions rather certain.

   But if your mind and your political identity are in a place where any
   criticism of Chipotle, or of anti-GMO arguments, is conclusive evidence
   of ill motives and corporate evil — well, you’re going to come up with
   the wrong number of M&Ms.
