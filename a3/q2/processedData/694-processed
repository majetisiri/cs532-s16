8 Great Elon Musk Business Quotes

   [14]Mike Schiemer Elon Musk Business Quotes Michael J Schiemer
   Elon Musk is one of the brightest business visionaries of our time with
   innovative companies under his belt like Tesla, Spacex, SolarCity, and
   Paypal. He has some great quotes that any entrepreneur could benefit
   from:
   1)  "If something is important enough you should try, even if the
   probable outcome is [15]failure."
   2)  "Failure is an option. If things are not failing, you are not
   innovating enough."
   3)  "I think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be
   [16]extraordinary."
   4)  "I think that's the best single piece of advice: constantly think
   about how you could be doing things [17]better and questioning
   yourself."
   [18]Mike Schiemer Elon Musk Business Quotes Michael J Schiemer
   5)  "My biggest [19]mistake is probably weighing too much on someone's
   talent and not somebody's personality. I think it matters whether
   someone has a good heart."
   6)  "Starting a company is liking eating glass and staring into the
   abyss. If you feel like you are up for that then [20]start a company."
   7)  "I like to be involved in things that change the world."
   8)  "I could either watch it happen or be a part of it."
   [21]Mike Schiemer Elon Musk Business Quotes Michael J Schiemer
