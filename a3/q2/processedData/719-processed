       I don't think that Yelp is the place to rate chain restaurants but
       the service at the Signal Hill Chiptole has always been friendly
       and fast.   Even during the busy lunch hours, I'm always greeted
       with a smile and the staff seem to enjoy their jobs.
       The portions are always reasonable and the taste is always the best
       as expected.  I'd go a little out of my way to hit this Chiptole
       than some closer ones.

       This location always seems to be missing something but it's the
       closest to me so I have to make due.
       My trip today consisted of waiting almost 10 minutes while the
       chicken was being replenished, the absolute last of the black
       beans, scraps of remaining veggies, and zero green tobasco sauce
       available or seen anywhere on tables or on top of the trash cans.
       Two stars because at least the employees are nice, just not well
       run.

       I love Chipotle but I really dislike this location.  The employees
       are unfriendly and the customer service is non-existent.  Last time
       I came, I ordered a chicken & steak bowl.  They are very stingy
       with their portions and give you the bare minimum of each
       ingredient.  I asked for white rice and they give me a small scoop.
        When I told the lady no beans, just more rice, she gave me less
       then half a scoop and passed my bowl on to the next person.  I
       completely understand when they try to minimize on giving you meat,
       but rice is so cheap!  My bowl was only halfway filled by the time
       it reached the end of the line... for the price I paid, I felt
       cheated.
       Since I was on my lunch break, I quickly took my food and left.  My
       work is only 3 minutes from this chipotle so it only sat 6-8
       minutes by the time I got back to my desk to eat it.  The food was
       completely cold!  Even the steak tasted like it just came from the
       fridge.  I called immediately and requested to speak with the
       manager.  All the manager could tell me was he didn't get any other
       complaints about it & to bring it back so they could make another
       bowl.  Rude! Unfortunately, I didn't have time to bring it back so
       had to eat as is.  Very disappointed!

       When I hear someone mention Chipotle, Barbacoa always comes to
       mind. So, I knew that's what I'd be ordering as I stood in line
       waiting to place my order. It was a little busy as it was lunch
       hour and I guess a lot of people made their way to Chipotle, now
       that there's finally a location in the area of Atlantic and Spring,
       in Long Beach. I just happened to swing by with a coworker because
       we needed something fast because we had an afternoon meeting right
       after lunch.
       Line moved along pretty steadily. Serving portion was okay - seen
       more and seen less at other locations. My portion size was more
       than the person behind me so I'm not complaining. Staff was
       somewhat friendly - efficient as they kept the line moving. The
       staff clearing tables was pretty efficient - as I mentioned earlier
       - it was a little busy because of the lunch rush.
       My burrito was what I expected. My coworker felt the same about her
       chips & guac as well as her bowl.
       Chipotle won't be a regular lunch spot for me but now that there's
       one close to work, it's there should I decide I need to get my
       yearly fix.

       Please scrape your damn grill!!!  Every time I come to this
       location, the grill is black.  So every single time I have to pick
       out the overly burnt chicken in my bowl. EVERY SINGLE TIME.

       I'm not a huge Chipotle fan in the first place, but this was the
       most disgusting burrito I've ever had in my entire life!  My mom &
       I went to this place and got a burrito with the normal fix-ins.
       She ate less than half of it and quit eating it because it was so
       gross and she did not want it.  So I tried a bite of it and OMG.
       Ewwwwww.  It was disgusting.  It was a pile of MUSHY ingredients
       wrapped up in a tortilla.  Literally mush and looked like baby
       food!  If it had been any mushier, it would have been soup!  With
       the normal ingredients, she asked for light sour cream and
       guacamole and it was as if they put an entire container of sour
       cream and guacamole in there.  Totally gross...it resembled baby
       food!  Will not be returning to Chipotle Mexican Grill ever!

       I visited Chipotle on September 21, 2015 at about 9:35pm. I had
       never been to this location before. I entered and there was no
       line. As I was placing my order I felt like the staff was rushing
       my through the line as if they were busy. There was no one behind
       me.
       I wanted to order a half steak and half barbacoa bowl, but before I
       could even say the other half of my order the staff member had
       already put half steak and half chicken. I didn't object because it
       wasn't a big deal to me. My boyfriend ordered a steak bowl, as
       well. The staff member handling the meat put such a small portions
       of meat and didn't even give me time to ask for onions and bell
       peppers before she passed my bowl to the next staff member. I had
       to ask the new member for more meat and onions and bell peppers.
       She looked at the bowls and added a bit more, and didn't tell me it
       was an extra charge for extra meat nor was I charged.
       When I was paying I realized we forgot to ask for a tortillas. The
       cashier told the first staff member in the assembly line and she
       made them for us. I was getting my drink as they were making them.
       The cashier then called me over and said it was ready. When she
       handed it to me it was so hot I had to throw it on the counter next
       to the fountain drinks. I would have appreciated a warning on how
       hot they were. When I got home the skin on my hand had bubbled from
       the burn and I touched the tortillas and they were still scorching
       hot.
       Call me old fashioned but I prefer my food without injury.

       Chipotle always comes to mind for a quick bite. Speedy service
       keeps me coming back. I always get the chicken or steak bowl with
       extra protein and it's always enough to share with my significant
       other. Minus the cheese and sour cream of course, let's keep those
       empty calories to a minimum. The black beans are a must but the
       attendants are light-handed with that scoop for some reason. I grew
       up on beans so give me more when you see me coming. The chicken has
       never dissapointed with its flavor and freshness. Nothing beats
       grilled chicken over a flame grill. The last few trips here have
       been especially outstanding because of the liberal amount of salt
       on their tortilla chips. Chipotle uses a very big grain of salt
       which carries tons of flavor. Add that to the avocado and you have
       yourself an authentic Mexican dining experience. If they could only
       make a spicier sauce, that would put them over the top.

       Food is good and consistent with other chipotles around.  Service
       there is inconsistent, some days you get a great host and some days
       you don't.  For a fast food place I don't really nitpick on
       service.  I'm just there for my food and I'm out.  Only thing that
       I wish they would do is to fill up the vinaigrette dressing up to
       the top so that I don't have to ask for a second one and then they
       won't have to roll their eyes at me for wanting a second dressing
       for my salad.

       I love Chipotle... I love the concept of assembly line Mexican
       food. For me, burrito bowl is the way to go, and I always get half
       and half of sofritas and chicken (or steak, if I am feeling beefy
       that day). I always ask for sour cream on the side, because
       Chipotle seems to love giving blobs of sour cream (I blame the
       spoon they use.) Too much sour cream is too much.
       I give this location a 3 star because of the store itself. Its very
       nice and clean! But damn the store itself is way too small. The
       line wraps around the perimeter of the store, which at times BLOCKS
       the entrance. There's a few tables inside, but there's even more
       seating outside. I'm guessing they made the store smaller to
       accommodate a larger patio (which has a great view of DT Long
       Beach)?

       Skimped me on my ingredients didn't add enough meat or anything for
       that matter, expect gross lettuce to my entree . At other locations
       they are very generous with your food . First time here and will be
       my last. Also taste like they don't wash there lettuce and they are
       cut into big pieces, so unlike other chipotles.

       I loved Chipotle when I'd visit the one in the Traffic Circle. This
       one turned me off because the food was cold when I got home and
       cheese not even melted?
       They need to learn food storage as well for online orders as I ask
       for my sour cream on the side and they always put it in the bag and
       put it in the warmer. I always take it out and ask for a new, cold
       one.

       I don't know why everyone is being a bunch of jerks about this
       place, but it is pretty much like every freakin Chipotle around.
       Yes, at lunch time a lot of people all show up at once and get in a
       line to order their food, and yes you have to wait patiently.  They
       are new so maybe the crew hasn't gotten into a rhythm yet, but I
       don't think it is any worse than any other one that I have been to.
       The place is clean, they have a nice outdoor patio area, and the
       staff is friendly and courteous.  Though pricey I enjoy being able
       to eat somewhere that promotes organic products, and lets you know
       which ingredients are GMO or not.  Also, they plan on phasing out
       all GMO products which is a tough task.
       This location is close to my work, and the couple of times I have
       been here I haven't had a problem.  I will continue to come to this
       location despite all the crappy reviews of apparently very
       impatient people.

       My siblings and I were hungry so we decided to go eat. We couldn't
       decide whether to get In N' Out or Chipotle since it was in the
       same plaza. In the end, we ended up getting Chipotle. Which turns
       out to be a huge mistake.
       We came around 9pm and there was only two people in front of us.
       The two stars are for the fast service. Everything else was pretty
       bad. The staff didn't look as friendly. The guy that serve us just
       gave us a cold stare like he didn't want to be there. I guess I
       understand because I work at a restaurant also. It can be stressful
       & annoying but he didn't even bother to just try or at least say
       something, like a hi maybe?
       Plus the food was plain, didn't have much flavors to it. I was
       disappointed because I expected better after it has been opened for
       about 2+ months! C'mon now. I think I'll just drive further to the
       traffic circle or to the lakewood one instead next time. Sorry
       guys! I won't be trying it in a while so that it could be improved.
       Considering I don't eat Chipotle a lot.
       Well I hope people have better experience than I did today. Don't
       want to sound mean but woops. Won't be coming here anytime soon.
       It's a nice location too. So whenever you're indecisive... go for
       In N' Out! You can never go wrong with that.

       The service SUCKS at this location! They're very stingy with all
       the ingredients people love chipotle because of the nice big
       burritos and stuffed bowls , me and my husband always go around
       7-8pm and they NEVER have guacamole! They always say sorry we ran
       out I don't get it? you still have a couple hours until closing
       time shouldn't they be making another batch?

       Today was actually my second attempt to eat here. The first time,
       the line wrapped around the entire inside of the place and NO
       Chipotle is worth that. Today I beat the lunch crowd.
       Good thing that I did because I don't know how there can be 6
       people behind the counter with 18 people in line but I'm the only
       one who had food. That's pretty bad service! Also the bathroom was
       pretty nasty considering they had only been open for an hour when I
       got there. Yuck! There were at least 4 other employees besides the
       ones at the counter, so someone really should have been tending the
       place.
       Food itself was standard, so no complaints there.

       This review is coming to you live from the line at Chipotle. No
       matter what time you go, I'm sure it'll be packed. If you plan to
       come during lunch/dinner time, make sure you bring the Harry Potter
       collection books because by the time you're ready to order, you're
       already on the Order of the Phoenix. The staff consists of very
       young workers that don't look like they really care. I know when
       they run out of chicken or steak, hell breaks loose and no one
       wants to settle for lame azz barbacoa. So the line gets paused,
       next thing you know the line goes all the way out to the Dollar
       Tree and the cycle repeats.
       By the time I got to the register, I stood there for a good amount
       of time to run a marathon without anyone acknowledging the fact
       that my food was ready and I was ready to pay for my burrito with
       chips and a side of disappointment. An employee finally rung me up.
       No sorry. No smile. No "have a nice day".
       This establishment is fairly new and it's great that I don't have
       to travel across the universe to Lakewood or the Traffic Circle for
       some Chipotles. However the staff all seems like rookies and no one
       is being a Kobe Bryant and leading the team.
       Shout outs to Chipotle.

       What the heck is wrong with people! This is the best chipotle on
       the planet, they are always extremely friendly and the food is
       awesome. That's probably why the lines always out the door. I don't
       mind waiting though because it's worth it!

       Yikes
       Poorly managed, inexperienced workers. There's always a long line,
       which I usually don't mind if it goes by fast, which never happens
       at this location. They are constantly running out of certain types
       of meat and I see them trying to cook it last minute and have the
       ALL the customers in line wait (Hello?? Where's the manager to make
       sure this doesn't happen???). Chips are usually stale and when
       they're not, they're not available. Horrible location. I'd rather
       trek over to the traffic circle. Maybe I'll come back and check in
       a few months. Maybe not.
