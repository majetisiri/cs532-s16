The various skylights integrated by Onyx Solar at the building’s entrance
have an original circular shape.


   [29]Miami Heat

   The skylights are composed of different crystalline silicon
   photovoltaic glass custom-made for the occasion. This glass enable the
   stadium to generate 34.500 kWh yearly, to be used for the building’s
   self-consumption.

   Thanks to the various activities carried out for the modernization of
   the building, it has become the first sports and entertainment center
   to obtain the LEED Gold recertification.

Onyx Solar photovoltaic glazing in skylights enables savings up to 95% in the
building’s electric bill


   Graphic

   For instance, a photovoltaic skylight in Miami, enables to obtain an
   energy cost of less than 1 cent, which means savings in the building’s
   energy bill of up to 95%. These outstanding savings make the internal
   return rate (IRR) of Onyx Solar’s photovoltaic skylight to be at 77%,
   recovering the investment within 1 year.

   Check in our [39]ROI Map the Feasibility Study of a photovoltaic
   skylight in your city. If you do not find the city you are looking for,
   please contact us.

[44]THE US SOLAR AND ARCHITECTURE MARKETS CELEBRATE THE EXTENSION OF THE
INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT

     * [45]January 26, 2016 – 2:28 pm
     * Posted in [46]Onyx Solar
     * Tagged [47]ITC
     * [48]Leave a Comment

   Back in 1993, Sir Noman Foster stated that solar architecture was not
   about fashion, but rather about survival; and he was right. Nowadays,
   the building integrated photovoltaic market is worth $1.2 Billion, and
   it is expected to reach $6.3 Billion by 2022.

   The US market has a lot to celebrate. The recent federal legislative
   action extending the 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and the Bonus
   Depreciation towards 2021, paves the way for a bright future for solar
   architecture.

   Photovoltaic Glass

   According to the ITC extension, when installing a photovoltaic curtain
   wall, façade or skylight, you will recover 30% of its total cost via a
   tax credit. Such 30% credit extends not only to the photovoltaic glass
   itself, but also to the eligible property including curtain wall
   systems, sales and use taxes on the equipment, installation costs, and
   all electrical equipment such as inverters, breakers, energy storage
   devices…

   This federal measure, along with the bonus depreciation and other
   performance based incentives, turn any photovoltaic-glazed envelope
   into a great investment for developers and owners.

   Check out our feasibility and ROI reports [49]here and contact us
   at [50]usa@onyxsolar.com for additional information on our photovoltaic
   glass and the incentives.
