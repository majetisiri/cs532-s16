       I am a die-hard fan of Chipotle. If I had to choose only one meal
       to have for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the rest of my life,
       I'd choose a Chipotle burrito bowl with chicken, pinto beans, corn,
       lettuce, mild salsa, and fajitas. Chipotle is just awesome.
       I don't feel a need to specifically describe this Tex-Mex joint
       that's taken the nation by storm and is a college student favorite.
       The only reason why I'm giving this Chipotle a 4 instead of a 5 is
       because of the huge lines that I see every day, even during the
       summer; It's the downside of being such a popular establishment. As
       much as I love Chipotle, I'd rather not wait in a line that snakes
       all the way to the entrance.

       Ordered a steak bowl online, got a carnitas bowl with a bunch of
       toppings I don't even like. Ended up throwing the meal in the
       trash. Waste of money and time

       Absolutely delicious! The atmosphere was inviting and the service
       was swift. I was so full I didn't eat breakfast the next day even
       though I had leftovers! The price is also quite cheap for a place
       everyone raves about. I payed less than $10 for my chicken bowl,
       chips & salsa, and refillable drink.
       Some people complain about the service, but it depends on the time
       of day. It's across from the UF campus so why be suprised that it's
       typically full? I personally have never encountered any problems
       with the staff, but please experience it for yourself.

       My kind of burrito bowl :
       Chicken
       White rice
       Vegetables (bell peppers and onions) -2 servings
       Corn salsa
       Spicy salsa - 2 servings
       Sour cream
       Lettuce
       Fresh cilantro
       I avoid the cheese because I'm not a fan of mozzarella (or whatever
       cheese they serve) and i don't like beans too much
       All their ingredients are so fresh and go so well together, i can
       have this bowl every day!

       Long line but it's usually the case at this chipotle or any other
       for that matter.
       Right across the street from UF business buildings.
       Food is not bad. Most times chicken or meats are under cooked. Most
       items have a lot of salt or sodium.
       Not the healthiest but taste great!

       This seems to be the only Chipotle where you can only get one
       barely half filled dressing for free. If you ask for any more than
       that it's a dollar extra. Never seen this anywhere else and it's
       ridiculous.

       Do NOT go to this chipotle if you can help it. Every time I've ever
       gone to this location I've literally seen the workers carefully
       count the pieces of meat going into my bowl- and I order steak.
       Seeing as the prices have risen, I think I should be allowed more
       than 10 pieces of meat. And this doesn't just happen to me-
       everyone I've talked to complains over and over about this
       occurrence.
       If you want chipotle, the one on archer is your best bet to get the
       most food for the money you're spending!

       Chipotle never fails to deliver.
       Probably one of my favorite all around companies. I love that they
       are a customer friendly company and it shows by their tremendous
       growth over the years.
       The staff are typically always friendly and it seems like Chipotle
       must be treating them well.
       I have no suggestions as this company does everything right.

       Food: pretty good
       Service: Awful, I want to highlight the recent decline in service.
       Years ago the service was great and would easily be a 4 star
       review. The new people they have hired recently are rude and slow.
       They do not treat you as a customer should be treated and and are
       not trained well.

       I love Chipotle, just hate this location.
       I've been here twice for lunch, one during the summer, and one
       today and both times the staff was so rude.
       It sucks to go to a place and not be acknowledged except for "what
       can I get you" and then huffing and puffing while the employee gets
       your order.  Both times I ordered the salad, with a side of rice
       and was glared at because the person had to get a little bowl to
       put the rice in.
       Today when I was paying for my order, the girl didn't say anything
       to me except for my total and I felt bad for interrupting the
       enthralling conversation that she was having with the girl behind
       me.
       If I wanted to be treated like crap there are places to go where I
       can pay for that. I don't expect bad service from Chipotle.
       Needless to say, I won't be going back to this location.

       I'll start by saying that the food is 5 stars, but the customer
       service there is a 1, so... It had to be 3. This is not common, but
       I think they hired a new manager who, quite frankly, does not give
       a shit about Customer Service.
       It was around lunchtime yesterday when D and I went to eat some
       Chipotle. We ordered two bowls, for here. The first girl (working
       behind the press) made the first move that upset me. She scraped up
       the last bits of the crusty little chicken pieces in the container,
       even though there was fresh chicken waiting behind her. It wouldn't
       be as bad if she didn't know it were there, but the cook had just
       yelled "chicken!" right as we approached the line. HMMM fresh tasty
       chicken, I want that... Can I has? No. I didn't complain though, I
       figured the salsa side would cheer me up. The opposite happened!
       The blond girl working on the salsas was apparently in a bad mood,
       she hated the sight of a customer asking for anything. Mild, a
       little medium, corn... She puts a third of a spoonful of
       everything. I was confused, maybe Chipotle was running low on
       salsas. I asked if I could have a little more, she gave me THE
       DIRTIEST look and placed four more pieces of tomato on my plate,
       and four more kernels of corn. I asked for sour cream, and she did
       the same with that. I REALLY love sour cream, so I asked if she can
       put some more. She barely dipped the spoon into the sour cream
       before shaking it over my bowl. I stared at her, wondering if she
       was pulling some sort of sweet joke on me. She wasn't. Maybe she
       didn't care, or maybe, it thrilled her. I thought Chipotle was all
       about customer service... I usually get it. I'm not your usual
       complaining customer, Chipotle has never done me wrong. Until now.
       I'm not even going to get into the Guac situation that D ran into,
       but let's just say that the manager of the place does not believe
       in the saying "the customer is always right". He also backed up all
       of his employees even though they were all shitheads. I eat the
       Chipotle on a regular basis, but I really don't feel like coming
       back for a while.

       Chipotle and I fell in love in a sleepy college town in northern
       Florida, then I graduated, moved out to the Midwest, and she was no
       where to be found. Every time I came home we met up again, and the
       magic was still there.
       To clear up a few things:
       - Chipotle is NOT authentic Mexican food, nor does it claim to be.
       If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, go elsewhere (good
       luck finding it in Gainesville)
       - The burritos are in "San Francisco-style" sometimes called
       "Mission-style".
       - The Chef that started Chipotle began his culinary career in San
       Francisco
       - the first Chipotle opened in Denver
       - Chipotle is NOT owned by McDonalds (if you do about 7 seconds of
       research on google, you would realize this)
       - Yes, the rice is white, get over it.
       - Chipotle came before Moe's, Qdoba, Taco del Mar, and most other
       poser San Francisco-style burrito joints
       I feel that every ingredient in a Chipotle burrito is of
       exceptional quality when pit up against any restaurant. When pit
       against other places in its price range, it completely obliterates
       the competition.
       Please tell me where else you can get something as big as bicep,
       enough for two meals, for around six bucks? That's right, you
       CAN'T.

       Sure, it's not authentic Mexican or even really Tex-Mex, but
       they've taken the concept of burritos, tacos, et al and made it
       into fresh, tasty, fast food. The location across from the UF
       campus is certainly a prime location and besides, they really do
       seem to make things fresh and the staff are very friendly.
       I normally get the soft tacos, sometimes the hard tacos, and the
       meat is always tasty and the salsa tastes like it was made that
       morning. You can make things as spicy or not so spicy as you desire
       and it's all made right in fromt of you so it's a situation where
       by the time you're ready to pay for your meal before sitting down,
       your food is also ready.

       I love this place. Really, I do.
       I try to go here with a  friend at least twice a month religiously.
       It is conveniently located across from campus.
       For about 8 dollars you get a meal that will fill you up for the
       rest of the day. And it always does for me!
       I would re comment the chicken burrito, I get it every time and it
       never gets old.
       The condiments are free too!

       This review is about their service the day of our visit. We were
       there May 18th early. Actually I think they had just opened. Our
       food was made, but when we were checking out their register
       wouldn't scan the coupon one of us had. The lady who was helping us
       tried to get things to work, but had to get a manager to get it
       fixed. The line behind us was getting long. The cashier was very
       apologetic for the delay. Things got rung up and we were off to get
       our drinks. Then my friend noticed the item we had a coupon for
       didn't get removed so I went back up. Again the manager came out.
       We got that straightened out after more waiting. Again the cashier
       apologized for the problems and offered us chips to go with our
       meal, which we took. I thought it was a nice gesture. Our problems
       didn't end. It turned out that the dressing that comes with the
       salad was not right. We are experienced Chipotle lovers and love
       the fast fresh food. We felt we needed to let them know so my
       daughter when up and told the same cashier that something was odd
       about the dressing. We went back to our meal. The next thing I know
       the same lady that had been helping us brought over three new
       dressings that she had just made. She asked us to see if these were
       better, then went back and did it again until the dressing was
       right. In the end the dressing was made correctly and we finished
       our delicious meal. I feel like that one employee really went out
       of her way to make our visit better even though there were
       problems. If this had been my first visit I may not have returned,
       but I've been to many Chipotles in many states I know how they run.
       With any business there's going to be off days, but the great
       employees came make a huge difference.
