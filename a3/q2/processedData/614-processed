   Rego Apps has released an update to its Remote S application for the
   Apple Watch which lets you summon your car, display battery usage, and
   trigger HomeLink.
   Check out this video from Mark Schey of the summon feature in action...

   IFRAME: [31]https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXQ4rKDADrs?rel=0

   Features:
   - Fully functional Apple Watch app
   - Start car with Touch ID without needing a password (can be disabled)
   - Opens, connects, and issues commands faster than the Tesla app.
   - Camp Mode allows you to keep the HVAC on in the car even though there
   is no activity. Normally, the car will turn off HVAC after 30 minutes.
   - Trigger HomeLink even if the car is plugged in, not in PARK, or you
   are not near the car
   - Summon your car when not near it
   - Display battery usage (vampire drain)
   - Adjust the panoramic roof to more settings than just vent and close
   with a button or a % slider.
   - No-Commands Mode lets you log in the app for your family/friends to
   monitor your Tesla's location live without allowing them to issue
   commands to your car.
   - Breadcrumb tracking allows you to see the path that the car has
   recently taken.
   - Trip statistics shows your current MPGe, kWh used, miles traveled,
   kWh per 100 miles, cost savings vs. an internal combustion engine car,
   cost savings over the lifetime of your car, and many more fun stats.
   - Save trip routes to different save slots and compare the distance,
   kWh used, cost, and more for each route.
   - Accurate odometer/range readout with decimal places.
   - In-app browser can detect commands from javascript and html so that
   you can create and use a webpage to control your car
   - This opens up all sorts of functionality, such as scheduling, queued
   commands, and repeated commands
   - Consolidated stats and commands into one screen for quicker and
   easier access
   - Start/unlock car with Apple Watch without a password
   - Ability to change passenger and driver temperature settings
   separately instead of always together
   - Estimated range is displayed (this takes the average consumption of
   your past 30 miles and estimates your battery range based on that past
   usage)
   - Monitor all three ranges (estimated, rated, ideal/typical) at the
   same time without changing the settings in your car
   Along with the exclusive features, we also included the basic commands
   that will work on the Apple Watch and iPhone/iPad/iPod.
   - Unlock/lock car
   - Start/Stop HVAC (Heating and A/C)
   - Roof control (if you have a pano roof)
   - Temperature change
   - Honk horn
   - Flash lights
   - Enable/disable Valet Mode/Clear PIN
   - Summon reverse/forward/stop
   - Trigger HomeLink
   - Start and stop charging
   - Open/close charge port (if supported)
   - Car location display and tracking
   - Support for kilometers/miles and Celsius/Fahrenheit (the app will
   automatically read the settings from your car)
   - Display charging stats (amperage, phases, voltage, mi/hr, time left,
   etc.)

   What's New In This Version:
   New exclusive functions!
   - Trigger HomeLink even if the car is plugged in, not in PARK, or you
   are not near the car
   - Summon your car even when not near it
   - Display battery usage (including vampire drain). Can be turned off in
   the settings.
   Added functionality to both Apple Watch and iOS devices
   - To access the new Summon/HomeLink functionality (if your car supports
   it), first enable it in your car settings if you haven't already.
   - On the Apple Watch, Summon/HomeLink buttons are found by pressing
   down hard on the map screen.
   - On the Apple Watch, Valet Mode and Map Settings are found by pressing
   down hard on the secondary (4 button) screen accessed by pressing the
   bottom-right button on the Temperature screen. If you have a pano roof,
   this is the Roof settings screen.
   - On the iOS device, Summon/Valet Mode is accessed by pressing the
   command menu icon on the top-left and then pressing the car icon with
   the circle around it on the top-right
   Changes for iOS
   - Displays the time the data was last updated
   - Default refresh rate for new users is now 9 seconds instead of 5 to
   lessen the load on Tesla's servers
   - Changed default gas price to $3
   - Battery current/usage are now displayed by default (adjust the
   battery voltage in the settings for a more accurate battery power usage
   calculation)
   - Car switch icon now looks like a gear/cog
   - Added button to settings for those without a pano roof
   - Open Port/Charge buttons are now one button
   Bug fixes
   - App should start up a bit faster than before
   - Fixed expiring token/login errors
   - Fixed graphic showing front defroster on when actually off
   - Fixed stability issues
   - Fixed rounding error when using precise stats
   - Fixed charging current to display the correct current
   - "Complete" will now display when the charging is complete (corrected
   the charging cable status as well)
   Hidden Functions in iOS devices
   - New in version 3.0: Tapping on the big blue car graphic will attempt
   to wake up the car and reconnect to it.
   - Error messages appear if a command fails. Turning on notifications
   allows the app to tell you if a command fails even if the app is put in
   the background after issuing a command. So you can just fire-and-forget
   your command without waiting for a confirmation afterwards.
   - New wider slider controls for charge limit and driver/passenger
   temperature settings. Activate it by tapping on the Charge Limit %.
   - Tapping on the top-left area of the car stats box (where the Current
   is) toggles the command menu.
   - Long pressing the middle-right area of the car stats box (where the
   Fan Speed/Outside temperature is) toggles climate control.
   - Long pressing the middle-left area of the car stats box (where the
   Voltage/Charge rate is) toggles lock/unlock.
   - Long pressing the bottom-right area of the car stats box (where the
   Ideal/Rated range is) opens the app settings page.
   - Long pressing the bottom-middle area of the car stats box (where the
   Estimated range is) unlocks the car and starts keyless driving (TouchID
   or password still required).
   - Long pressing the bottom-left area of the car stats box (where the
   Charge % is) opens the car selector and signout menu.
   - Tapping on the top-right area of the car stats box (where the Inside
   Temp is) toggles the roof settings menu if you have a pano roof
   installed. Otherwise it toggles the charge limit and temperature
   sliders.
   - Tapping on each pin's info bubble now gives you the distance from
   your car to the pin as well as directions on how to get there and the
   ability to copy the full address or coordinates to your clipboard.
   - Added the ability to change the roof percent open by using a slider.
   You can also tap the roof above the slider to open and close the roof.
   You can purchase Remote S for Tesla from the App Store for $13.99.

   You can spend 30 from Ebay and get a low intelligent watch. You can
   spend 199 - 299 with an Android Watch and you get a somewhat updated
   software but it has the same feature as the Ebay version. You can spend
   299 for an Iwatch and you can call you car, house, Take a selfie with a
   Drone chopper... and updates when there are improvements or bugs.

   because it can't do much - February 6, 2016 at 9:35pm
   Because android itself tries to throw so much in that even it's
   standalone watch features don't change much.
