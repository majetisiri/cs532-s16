   New class action lawsuit alleges yes.

   Chipotle's annus horribilis just got worse: The restaurant chain was
   hit with [27]a class action lawsuit Tuesday. Filed by high-profile
   California law firm Robertson & Associates, LLP, the suit alleges that
   a Simi Valley Chipotle branch was aware a kitchen manager was sick
   "with gastrointestinal symptoms" for two days, and thereby [28]infected
   customers with norovirus on August 18 and 19, 2015. Most damningly, the
   suit alleges Chipotle's corporate office wavered before contacting
   authorities and customers, and employees purposely concealed evidence
   of the outbreak before alerting health officials.

   Ventura County estimated the Chipotle at the heart of the lawsuit
   served a total of 3,000 meals over the course of the 48-hour period,
   inflicting some 234 customers with headaches, fever, stomach pain,
   vomiting, and diarrhea. The class action's plaintiffs, six high school
   students and one parent who all ate food "adulterated with norovirus"
   at the Simi Valley restaurant, are seeking a jury trial and unspecified
   damages.

   Steve Ellis, Chipotle's co-founder and CEO, [29]delivered a widely
   disseminated apology last month after outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella,
   and norovirus at restaurants across the country [30]prompted other
   lawsuits. "From the beginning, all of our food safety programs have met
   or exceeded industry standards. But recent incidents, an E. coli
   outbreak that sickened 52 people and a norovirus outbreak that sickened
   approximately 140 people at a single Chipotle restaurant in Boston,
   have shown us that we need to do better, much better," Ellis' statement
   read, in part. Amid all this bad publicity, the chain [31]has bold
   plans to win back customers.
