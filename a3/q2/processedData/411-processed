Day After Day
We’re Committed

To sourcing the very best ingredients we can find
and preparing them by hand.

To vegetables grown in healthy soil, and pork
from pigs allowed to freely root and roam outdoors or in deeply bedded barns.

We're committed because we understand the
connection between how food is raised and prepared,
and how it tastes.

We do it for farmers

animals

the environment

dentists

crane operators

ribbon dancers

magicians

cartographers

and you.

With every burrito we roll or bowl we fill, we're working
to cultivate a better world.

In the Kitchen

Whole OR NOTHING

Real ingredients just taste better.

   We're all about simple, fresh food without artificial flavors or
   fillers. Just genuine raw
   ingredients and their individual, delectable flavors. We source from
   farms rather than
   factories, and spend a lot more on our ingredients than many other
   restaurants.
   We wouldn't have it any other way.

Culinary Chops

We actually cook in our kitchens.

   Great ingredients deserve great preparation. Morning to night, our
   skilled crews
   use classic cooking techniques on the meticulously sourced meats and
   produce
   that are delivered regularly to each restaurant. It's no coincidence
   that our founder
   and Co-CEO is a classically trained chef.

G-M-Over It

One strong stance deserves another.

   In 2013, Chipotle made headlines for becoming the first national
   restaurant chain to voluntarily
   disclose the presence of GMOs in our food. In 2015, we succeeded in our
   quest to switch
   to serving food made only with non-GMO ingredients.
   [26]Learn more about why we're saying "Farewell" to GMOs.

ON THE FARM

RESPONSIBLY RAISING THE BAR

   We care deeply about where our ingredients come from. While industrial
   farming practices have evolved to maximize profits and production, we
   make an extra effort to partner with farmers, ranchers, and other
   suppliers whose practices emphasize quality and responsibility. See how
   we're making choices with farmers, animals, and the environment in
   mind.

FARMS

   We believe that small farms come in many sizes, that it's more about
   what you do than how big you are. Our suppliers share many of our
   values. Here are two to chew on.
   Long-Term Partnership

   We develop close relationships with many of the farmers, ranchers, and
   other suppliers who produce the ingredients we serve every day.
   [27]Learn more
   Respecting the Soil

   We partner with farms that prioritize the long-term health of their
   land.
   [28]Learn more
   Bracket

Animals

   We think that animals raised outdoors or in deeply-bedded pens are
   happier and healthier than those raised in confinement. With our
   suppliers, we take a firm stand on two things.
   Giving them Space

   We're serious about pasture-raised animals that have room to be
   animals.
   [29]Learn more
   Healthy Livestock

   There's no place for nontherapeutic antibiotics and synthetic hormones
   on the farms that produce our ingredients.
   [30]Learn more
   Curved Bracket

ENVIRONMENT

   Every choice we make—about who we work with, what we serve, and what we
   stand for—affects the bigger picture: the health of the planet.
   Nutrient-rich soil reduces the need for pesticides and synthetic
   fertilizers, buying locally reduces vehicle emissions from
   transportation, and humane animal husbandry means diminished reliance
   on antibiotics. As we strive each day to be better, we keep in mind
   that everything is connected.

CULTIVATING A BETTER WORLD

   We've always done things differently, both in and out of our
   restaurants. Check out how we're changing the face of fast food,
   starting conversations, and directly supporting efforts to shift the
   future of farming and food. We hope you'll join us as we continue to
   learn, evolve, and shape what comes next.

CULTIVATE FESTIVAL

   In 2010, we launched the [31]Cultivate Festival,
   a free event held each year in three cities
   that brings together food, music, and ideas.

THE SCARECROW

   [32]"The Scarecrow" iOS game and accompanying
   animated short film got people talking about
   farming and the future of real food.

CHIPOTLE CAREERS

   With a tradition of mentorship and promoting
   management from within, Chipotle is a place to [33]build a
   career and have fun while you're at it.

Founder and Co-CEO Steve

   How many classically trained chefs start fast food restaurants? In
   1993,
   Steve Ells did just that, opening the first Chipotle and
   bringing fresh thinking and real food knowledge to an
   industry all about cheap ingredients and addictive additives.
   Fast food hasn't been the same since.

FARMED & DANGEROUS

   We branched into live-action storytelling with
   an [34]original comedy series that pokes fun at
   the unsustainable world of industrial
   agriculture.

CULTIVATE FOUNDATION

   The [35]Chipotle Cultivate Foundation is a non-profit
   organization that funds initiatives supporting sustainable
   agriculture, family farming, and food education. Through
   events like our annual Boorito promotion at Halloween,
   we've contributed over $3 million to what we believe in.

   Local

   Buying local strengthens rural communities and means you get delicious
   seasonal produce that's traveled fewer miles to your plate.

   In 2014, we served over 20 million pounds of locally grown produce, and
   plan to increase our numbers every year.

   Long-Term Partnerships

   Developing long-term, personal relationships with farmers means we can
   work closely with the people who raise the food we serve to ensure that
   our ingredients—and the practices used to raise them—are always
   improving. You’ll often find our ingredient buyers out on the road,
   visiting suppliers or performing audits. While building these
   relationships takes time, it helps farmers grow alongside Chipotle.

   Many of the farmers, ranchers, and other suppliers we work with have
   been part of the Chipotle family for 10-15 years—some of them, even
   longer. We still source ingredients from partners who’ve been with us
   since the days when there were only two or three Chipotles in our
   hometown of Denver.

   Tomato

   Farms that plant a variety of crops and rotate the fields where they're
   planted keep the soil nutrient-rich and the land healthier year after
   year.

   When the same crop is planted over and over in the same place (a
   practice called monoculture), the land suffers. Essential nutrients are
   depleted from the soil, and crops are more likely to fall prey to
   diseases and pest infestations, requiring the heavy use of chemical
   fertilizers and pesticides.

   Pig

   We set minimum space requirements for the animals producing the meat
   and dairy products that end up in our restaurants. We work with our
   suppliers to ensure the highest possible animal welfare standards, and
   are always setting the bar higher.

   If, due to supply shortages, we have to serve conventionally raised
   meat, we clearly post signs in the affected restaurants.

   Cross

   Antibiotics and hormones are given to a majority of livestock to
   increase production and combat the effects of overcrowding.

   We buy meat from farmers and ranchers who raise their animals without
   antibiotics and synthetic hormones. If animals fall sick, our protocols
   require that farmers bring them back to health in the most responsible
   manner possible.

Cultivate Festival

   In 2010, we launched the [57]Cultivate Festival, a free event held each
   year in three cities that brings together food, music, and ideas.

The Scarecrow

   [58]"The Scarecrow" iOS game and accompanying animated short film got
   people talking about farming and the future of real food.

Chipotle Careers

   With a tradition of mentorship and promoting management from within,
   Chipotle is a place to [59]build a career and have fun while you're at
   it.

   How many trained chefs start fast food restaurants? In 1993, Steve Ells
   did just that, opening the first Chipotle and bringing fresh thinking
   and real food knowledge to an industry all about cheap ingredients and
   addictive additives. Fast food hasn't been the same since.

Farmed & Dangerous

   We branched into live action storytelling with an [60]original comedy
   series that pokes fun at the unsustainable world of industrial
   agriculture.

Cultivate Foundation

   The [61]Chipotle Cultivate Foundation is a non-profit organization that
   funds initiatives supporting sustainable agriculture, family farming,
   and food education. Through events like our annual Boorito promotion at
   Halloween, we've contributed over $3 million to what we believe in.
