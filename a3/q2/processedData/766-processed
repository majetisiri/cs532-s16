The Secrets They Don’t Want You to Know About Nikola Tesla

   By [43]Matt Agorist on February 4, 2016

   Jim Murray has been a student of Nikola Tesla’s work for decades and
   his inventions based this work have been nothing short of paradigm
   shifting.

   In a recent[45] interview with the Free Thought Project, Murray
   explained that he was fascinated by Tesla’s incredible claims
   concerning power generation and transmission, and he vowed to
   rediscover the great scientist’s undisclosed secrets. Jim’s efforts
   eventually led him to individuals like Otis T. Carr, who claimed to
   have known Tesla personally. They also gave him a greater understanding
   of several lost Tesla secrets.

   Murray devoted his life to learning these secrets and because the
   government seized most of Tesla’s works, this has been no easy task.
   However, through piecing together information revealed during federal
   hearings, and vigorously studying Tesla’s available work, Murray was
   able to create a variety of different technological applications all of
   which eventually contributed to the development of his [46]SERPS
   (Switched Energy Resonance Power Supply) device.

   This highly specialized electronic circuit has the ability to “Magnify”
   the effective power applied to it by nearly 50 times. When Jim coupled
   his device with his friend Paul Babcock’s patented ultra fast 5
   nanosecond switching technology, they achieved a 4790% increase in
   electrical power compared to the input. This type of performance, if
   commercialized, would cause the largest electric utility companies to
   shake in their boots.

   One need only examine the contents of [47]Tesla’s patents to understand
   why the famous scientist was being [48]watched by the FBI. It is no
   secret that after Tesla’s death in 1943, government agents seized much
   of his private research.

   After watching J[49]im Murray’s decades of Tesla research in action,
   one can only imagine what other secrets lay beyond government doors.

   A brief video by the folks at [50]How Stuff Works explains many of the
   possibilities of why suppression and secrecy surround Nikola Tesla.

Groundbreaking Discovery: Man Solves Tesla’s Secret To Amplifying Power By
Nearly 5000%
     __________________________________________________________________

   [52]man-solves-tesla's-secrets

   Jim Murray has been electrifying the world for over 50 years. His
   lifetime of experience has produced dozens of patents, inventions and
   now a truly remarkable discovery that can fundamentally change the way
   that human beings use energy forever.

   When he was just five years old, Jim tells the Free Thought Project
   that he had already developed an affinity for motors and electricity.
   This curiosity was piqued by his father’s model train sets which Jim
   spent hours tinkering with. His natural gift and childhood passion
   fostered the creation of his first electromagnet when he was only six
   years old.

   Over the next several years, Jim allowed his intellectual curiosity to
   carry him into multiple fields. He studied and built rockets and radios
   when he was in grade school and by the time he entered high school had
   developed an interest in nuclear physics. This led Jim to the
   construction of a linear electron accelerator, which was entered in the
   New England Science Talent Search of 1964.  This entry won young Murray
   first place in school, city and state science competitions.
   Additionally, his project was displayed in the Boston Museum of
   Science.

   It was not long after graduation that Jim began seriously examining the
   work of Nikola Tesla. He was fascinated by Tesla’s incredible claims
   concerning power generation and transmission, and he vowed to
   rediscover the great scientist’s undisclosed secrets. Jim’s efforts
   eventually led him to individuals like Otis T. Carr, who claimed to
   have known Tesla personally. They also gave him a greater understanding
   of several lost Tesla secrets.

   During his professional life, Jim has conducted research and
   experimentation on a variety of different technological applications
   all of which eventually contributed to the development of his [53]SERPS
   (Switched Energy Resonance Power Supply) device.  This highly
   specialized electronic circuit has the ability to “Magnify” the
   effective power applied to it by nearly 50 times. When Jim coupled his
   device with his friend Paul Babcock’s patented ultra fast 5 nanosecond
   switching technology, they achieved a 4790% increase in electrical
   power compared to the input. This type of performance, if
   commercialized, would cause the largest electric utility companies to
   shake in their boots.

   Jim explains:

     Electric power is supplied by a special transformer to energize a
     resistive load. The undissipated  magnetic potential is then
     captured and stored temporarily, before being sent back to the
     source through the very same electrical load. This oscillating power
     has completely different properties than conventional electrical
     power, and actually reduces the total power required from the
     source.  The consequence of this energy dynamic is that the
     resistive load can be powered more than twice as efficiently, while
     the net power supplied by the line is reduced to a very small value.
     The implications of this technology for power conservation in the
     future are absolutely astonishing!

   In the video below Jim gave The Free Thought Project an exclusive look
   at his groundbreaking new technology.

   IFRAME: [54]https://www.youtube.com/embed/HK3JOlY0V8Y

   After watching this amazing innovation in action, it is hard to believe
   that Mr. Tesla reached this same technological plateau nearly
   one-hundred years ago, and still, there has been minuscule advancement,
   until very recently, in the industry of energy generation. One need
   only examine the contents of [55]Tesla’s patents to understand why the
   famous scientist was being [56]watched by the FBI. It is no secret that
   after Tesla’s death in 1943, government agents seized much of his
   private research.

   Jim’s research has also been scrutinized by the FBI. He tells The Free
   Thought Project that he, too, has had a run-in with the FBI because of
   one of the projects he was working on.

     “Back in 1966, not long after my father died, I returned from work
     one day to find a strange message waiting for me.

   When Jim attempted to ascertain the source of the message he was given
   a note that said:

     ‘Take the Hudson-Manhattan subway to Newark, New Jersey, and arrive
     at 11 Centre Place, FBI Newark Headquarters, no later than 10:00 AM
     tomorrow morning. Ask to see Agent Harold Miller, he will be
     expecting you.”

   Upon his arrival, agents began questioning Jim about his research.
   After informing them of his interest in Nikola Tesla’s work, Jim says:

     “The agents looked at each other silently, then scribbled some
     additional notes, which were inserted into a file folder with my
     name on it. I later learned that once you become a person of
     interest, the FBI retains your file indefinitely!”

   Thankfully Jim did not let this obvious scare tactic deter his
   research. Now, thanks to modern technological advancements and the
   tireless work of courageous men like Jim Murray, we can begin to
   understand the truly groundbreaking nature of Tesla’s original work.

   The ramifications of the mass application of SERPS technology are
   nothing short of paradigm shifting. It is widely known that the “energy
   variable” is a primary factor in US policies. The pursuit of energy is
   no doubt a catalyst for many of the decisions politicians regularly
   make. However, most Americans are only aware of the research efforts
   which involve the utilization of coal, petroleum, nuclear power, wind
   and solar. These accepted avenues of exploration receive [57]over 5
   billion dollars in subsidies per year, while independent researchers
   like Jim are totally ignored.

   The positive environmental impact of radical technologies like SERPS
   also cannot be understated. While lawmakers continue to pay lip service
   to the issue of global warming, this technology could drastically
   reduce the carbon footprint of the entire planet. [58]Mountaintop coal
   removal is destroying entire swaths of land, oil sands developments are
   already slated to be the cause of up to the [59]second fastest rate of
   deforestation, and hydraulic fracturing for oil & natural gas can
   require up to [60]15.8 million gallons of water per well.

   In 2012, the total energy output from wind power alone in the US
   surpassed 60 gigawatts, enough capacity to power nearly [61]15 million
   homes. While renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydro
   have been widely criticized as being inefficient to meet the nation’s
   energy demands. The obvious truth is that through the use of
   technologies like the SEPRS device, we can more than meet our energy
   needs.

   So long as organizations exist that can legally ensure the suppression
   of emerging technologies, the best interests of the people will always
   run secondary to the interests of those who have controlling ownership
   in traditional power systems. The same systems which ensure cash flow
   to the elite and continue to destroy our planet in the process.

   In addition to re-discovering Tesla’s technological secrets, Jim is
   also dedicated to revealing those secrets for the benefit of everyone.
   While he has independently secured funding for his technology already,
   Jim is also trying to secure funding to publish a book which will
   explain to everyone how it is done. If you would like to assist Jim you

   NikolaTesla was a genius and I truly respect him... But this is not
   why. The Richter's Scale measures the amount of energy released in an
   earthquake. It takes something on an fusion bomb scale to release that
   much energy... The earth is charged already. That's why lightning
   strikes the ground. He wanted to spread the energy through the air...
   But it looses too much power because the atmosphere isn't a good
   conductor. And "death Rays" are somewhat irrelevant when hydrogen bombs
   can ennihilate entire countries or electromagnetically bomb entire
   continents from space. These ideas were leftovers that never quite
   worked.

   I've known about this for years. Schools don't teach this, because it
   would cause the general public to know we've been lied to from the
   beginning. I still believe that is the reason why the electric car
   company is named Tesla. The owner is thumbing up his nose to the energy
   industry.
