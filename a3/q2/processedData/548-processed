Reports: Tesla Selects Nevada as Giga Battery Factory Site

   Reports: Tesla Selects Nevada as Giga Battery Factory Site

   Tesla has finally decided that it will build its battery factory near
   Reno, Nevada.

   As we reported in July, Tesla has broken ground on its immense battery
   factory outside of Reno, Nevada. That spot represented at least one of
   the two candidates for the factory.

   Today, sources cited by [67]CNBC say that Tesla has decided that it
   will build its battery factory in Nevada.

   A press conference is planned for tomorrow in Carson City, as per a Dow
   Jones report. We'll keep you updated.

   Here's our earlier reporting:

   It appears that work has already begun on the site of the new $5
   billion Tesla Giga factory near Reno, Nevada. It's the planned location
   of the world's largest lithium-ion battery factory and the potential
   enabler of lower-cost Tesla electric vehicles.

   Yesterday, our unnamed source (Bob Tregilus) hiked a few high-desert
   ridges in Storey County, Nevada to take pictures of 50 earthmovers
   moving earth at a site that Tregilus estimated to be large enough to
   accommodate the proposed 10-million-square-foot factory. Tregilus has
   also heard whispers about a secret project from construction industry
   folks and locals.

   The site is located at the Reno Tahoe Industrial Center at 2641
   Portofino Drive. Here's one of Tregilus' photos:

   It's a great photo, but it turns out that last month, the Reno
   Gazette-Journal [68]reported that "an excavation permit to begin site
   work for a sizable project has been pulled [on May 22] by the
   Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center" at 2641 Portofino Drive. The paper notes,
   "The business park could potentially begin site preparation work before
   any official contract with Tesla is signed, adding, "In addition to the
   excavation permit in Storey County, the contractor for the Portofino
   Drive project has air quality and storm water permits from the state's
   Environmental Protection Division." There was no confirmation that this
   is indeed the Tesla site.

   Reno has been considered the front-runner for Tesla's vertically
   integrated super factory.

   [69]In March we covered the deep politics surrounding the Tesla battery
   Giga factory -- which pitted Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada and
   California against each other for the rights to the $5 billion
   high-tech manufacturing site. Tesla aims to build 500,000 cars per year
   by 2020 and will need an unprecedented volume of lithium-ion batteries
   to hit this target.

   We recently covered a presentation from [70]Tesla CTO JB Straubel, in
   which he spoke of attacking the battery's cost with the Giga factory by
   "doubling the worldwide capacity in a single factory and reinventing
   the supply chain." A total of 35 gigawatt-hours of cell production from
   the new plant will be devoted to meeting the needs of the Fremont
   automotive plant, and 15 gigawatt-hours will be devoted to stationary
   battery packs. Straubel said that Tesla was "bullish" about the
   California energy storage mandate. Straubel also said he was bullish
   that stationary energy storage "can scale faster than automotive."

   The project has the potential to provide more than 6,000 jobs.

   Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, is intent on moving forward with two sites,
   according to Bloomberg, saying in an earlier interview, "What we’re
   going to do is move forward with more than one state, at least two, all
   the way to breaking ground, just in case there are last-minute issues."

Giga factory facts and figures

     * Tesla announced a $1.6 billion convertible debt offering. Tesla
       looks to offer $800 million of convertible senior notes due in 2019
       and $800 million due in 2021 to build the world's largest battery
       factory.
     * Elon Musk predicts that the new factory will produce batteries for
       500,000 vehicles by 2020.
     * Tesla expects to reduce the kilowatt-hour price of batteries by 30
       percent.
     * The plan is for construction to start in 2014, with production
       beginning in 2017.
     * The facility will house more than 6,000 workers in 10 million
       square feet of factory space.
     * The plant will provide recycling capability for old battery packs.
     * Musk also said that Panasonic, currently supplying hundreds of
       millions of cells to Tesla, would likely join in on the new
       factory, but no commitments have been made.
