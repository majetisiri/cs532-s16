Blatant attempts to steal Chipotle customers.

   Chipotle wants everyone to know that it is taking the
   [77]reputation-damaging food poisoning episodes that have taken place
   at its restaurants very seriously. To ensure all of its employees are
   up to speed on the latest efforts to guarantee food safety, Chipotle is
   taking the drastic step of [78]shutting down all locations for a spell
   on Monday, Feb. 8, in order to conduct a nationwide meeting.

   While the restaurant world in general must theoretically commend such a
   commitment to food safety, Chipotle’s competitors are seizing the
   moment as an opportunity to drum up business when it’s physically
   impossible for consumers to buy a Chipotle burrito. Here are some deals
   and promotions on burritos and other Mexican fare that are available
   during Chipotle’s Feb. 8 shutdown:

   [79]Freshii
   The Canadian burrito restaurant chain is offering [80]50% off Mexican
   fare during the hours that Chipotle is closed on Monday.

   [81]On the Border
   This chain of sit-down Mexican restaurants just so happened to choose
   Monday, Feb. 8, as the day to launch to-go burritos and bowls, at a
   special price of $5 each ($1 extra for steak or shrimp).

   [82]Moe’s Southwest Grill
   “Not only is Moe’s Southwest Grill open on February 8, we’re also
   offering a Buy One, Get One deal so you and your friend or colleague
   can enjoy the best rebound burrito on the market – complete with all
   the free chips and salsa you can pack in,” a note from the company
   said.

   [84]Taco Bell
   The latest oddball promotion from Taco Bell involves a [85]mysterious
   new menu item that won’t be announced publicly until the company airs
   its Super Bowl commercial this Sunday. Select customers were allowed to
   [86]pre-order the mystery item for consumption on Saturday, Feb. 6—yes,
   the idea is you order and pay without knowing what it is—and the hyped
   new treat will go on sale to the public on Monday, Feb. 8. That’s the
   day Chipotle is shutting down, if you weren’t aware.
