Elon Musk
       Tesla may get all the credit these days for making electric cars
       popular, but that won't be what history books say if General Motors
       has anything to say about it.
       General Motors will make electric cars for the masses a reality,
       Stuart Norris, GM’s head designer for its all-electric Chevy Bolt,
       told Tech Insider.
       And GM will do it first, before Tesla.
       Norris wants GM to be remembered as the company that brought
       all-electric cars to the masses.
       The Chevy Bolt, which is going into production this year, will have
       a range of more than 200 miles and cost about $30,000 after
       incentives, making it the first long-range, mass market electric
       car.
       “I don’t know whether we are necessarily in the same market as
       Tesla...Teslas are a very elite car. This is not an elite car. This
       is a car that everybody can own,” Norris said.
       Tesla vehicles begin pricing at about $75,000 and feature many
       luxury details. A massive touchscreen command center and retracting
       door handles are just a few of the many luxury features in Tesla
       vehicles that won't show up in the more affordable, mass market
       cars coming from GM (and Tesla too — more on that in a minute).
       “From a capability point of view, I think we are definitely on
       par," Norris continued. "The fact that we are able to deliver a
       vehicle of this size at this price really puts us in a field of our
       own and really ahead of the pack on where electric vehicles are
       going."
       Tesla's next car, the Model 3, is expected to cost around $35,000,
       with a range of more than 200 miles per charge. It's planned for
       sale at some point in 2017. It's the first affordably priced car
       from Tesla, aimed at broad audiences. It's Tesla's answer to GM's
       Bolt.
       Chevy Bolt Chevrolet
       The Model 3 will be Tesla's first foray into creating mass market
       cars, so only time will tell whether or not its plan to make more
       affordable vehicles will work. The company's track record so far
       has been consistently successful —Tesla Motors went from selling
       about 600 cars per year five years ago to about 50,000 cars per
       year in 2015.
       Even then, Norris said he still believes GM has an edge in the
       space because of its experience in developing electrified vehicles.
       Chevrolet already offers the Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid
       vehicle that prices around $30,000, and the Spark EV, which is an
       all-electric car that has a range of about 82 miles per charge and
       costs about $20,000. With the Bolt, Chevy will have developed four
       generations of electric vehicles.

       “We’ve always been at the heart of electrification in the
       automotive space,” Norris said. “So I think that is where we are
       going to bring our very own unique perspective to the market."
       Still, Tesla's success in creating high-end electric vehicles has
       likely played a role in spurring automakers to increase investment
       in their electrification programs.
       Other car companies planning to make an all-electric vehicle in the
       next few years include Porsche, Audi, and Volkswagen.
       While increased competition might scare some companies, it's always
       been part of the plan for Tesla.
       The company's CEO Elon Musk has said numerous times that he
       welcomes car companies entering the electric car space because his
       ultimate goal is to transition the world to electric vehicles, and
       he can’t do that alone.
       Elon Musk Tesla AP
       In fact, in 2014 Tesla even made all of its technology open source
       so that other car companies could use its tech to build electric
       vehicles.
       During an [25]interview with CNN last month Musk commented
       specifically on GM coming to market with a long range electric car
       calling the news "great."
       "If GM or any other company comes out with electric cars that is
       good for the world and we would applaud them," Musk said.
