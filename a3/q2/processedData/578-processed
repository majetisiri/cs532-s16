   Report: Two-Thirds Of Early Tesla Model S Drivetrains May Fail By
   60,000 Miles

   Survey data collected by Plug-In America from current early-model
   [40]Tesla Model S owners has predicted that up to two-thirds of early
   model electric-drive units may fail by 60,000 miles. If their
   predictions are even remotely accurate, that’s bad news.

   The Tesla Model S is the trendiest car in America. It’s also just a
   fine piece of American… [46]Read more Read more

   Despite the all-electric Tesla Model S being so impressive, [47]even
   breaking Consumer Reports’ review scale, it is known that early
   production years of the car have [48]had a decent share of reliability
   issues. This isn’t too surprising as Tesla is still a young automaker.
   The company reported in November a drastic reduction of these issues
   (by 50 percent) in their more-recent model years.

   Improvements aside, those early cars still face issues that first and
   second-hand buyers — and ultimately Tesla — are going to have to deal
   with, with a recent study conducted by Plug-In America — a neutral and
   non-profit party — claiming up to 66 percent of earlier model-year
   Model S drivetrains are likely to fail by 60,000 miles based on
   consumer-reported data.

   As reported by [49]Green Car Reports, the sample data was run twice
   with the information they collected from early Model S owners. The
   analysis covered 327 respondents to the survey in October, or about one
   percent of 2012 to 2013 model year owners. 43 respondents were later
   model year (2014+) owners. The survey included inquiries about the
   mileage of the vehicles, ownership experience, whether or not the car
   had received a drivetrain swap, and if so, the mileage at the time of
   the repair.

   Sponsored

   The data was then collected and processed using a Weibull statistical
   analysis for probability distribution, which estimates reliability
   lifetimes. The results map out the lifetime reliability for vehicle
   drivetrains that haven’t yet failed.

   The study concluded that 77 drivetrains had failed compared to 250
   “suspends,” or samples that haven’t yet failed.

   The results of the second study were based on only the final odometer
   reading and not the reported reading at the time of the maintenance for
   those vehicles that had received a swap. This adjusted for
   “transcription errors” in the data sample. The results are as follows:

     The reliability engineer was careful to emphasize that the results
     were only valid if the data was correct, had no selection bias, and
     was random. While selection bias was definitely in play (only those
     customers who knew about the survey could choose to fill it out) the
     sample covered more than 1 percent of the total population of 2012
     and 2013 Teslas (327 respondents for about 25,000 vehicles).

     So selection bias and randomness were probably acceptably low. But
     on a line-by-line review of the Excel data file, I noticed a few
     transcription errors which indeed compromised the result.

     When cleaning the data set, to give Tesla the benefit of the
     doubt—where respondents had reported a motor swap but didn’t specify
     when it happened—I used the final odometer reading. (This would push
     up the characteristic life slightly.)

     For 2012 and 2013 Teslas, the characteristic life rose to about
     57,000 miles. (The probability function predicted that 66 percent of
     drive trains would fail within 60,000 miles.

   To clarify, the initial study by a “reliability engineer” found the
   “characteristic life” to be 50,000 miles. The second study, above, was
   worked by GCR using a free online software, which used the final
   odometer reading of the study data, concluding the characteristic life
   to be 57,000 miles before the drivetrain would need to be replaced.

   Plugged in to the probability function, it’s predicted that 66 percent
   of models will need the replacement by around 57,000 miles, or as
   reported, safely “under 60,000 miles.”

   That is, again, based off of around only one percent of early Model S
   owners, with adjusted numbers to account for slight errors in the
   transcription of the original data, and including some models beyond
   the 2012 and 2013 model years.

   Also, this study does not account for all 100,000 Model S vehicles on
   the road, and with Tesla claiming a 50 percent improvement in
   reliability, the general reliability lifetime for all Tesla Model S
   models could be much longer than the reported 60,000 miles.

   On that same note, the sample data is only pooled from those willing to
   fill out a survey, and users who have experienced reliability issues
   are naturally more likely to be willing to submit to a reliability
   study. The study doesn’t focus on only 2012 to 2013 model years, and
   including the 43 later-model samples skews the result of the quoted
   headline. If the study is to reflect all Model S vehicles sold, it only
   represents 0.3 percent of the vehicles sold from 2012 to today. Either
   way the study isn’t strict by any standard, and a very rough
   estimation.

   Still, these early owners involved in the study are more likely to end
   up getting the drivetrain swap, which will be covered by Tesla’s eight
   year warranty that comes with every Model S anyway. It should also be
   noted that a drivetrain swap for the Model S is a standard maintenance
   practice for moderate to severe issues, and only takes 24 to 48 hours
   for a Tesla maintenance location to perform the swap.

   The results of the study do show that Telsa will likely continue to
   have reliability issues with their earlier vehicles which may
   negatively impact customer satisfaction.

   Green Car Reports has three pages of information on the study,
   including links to the data sets and a full description of their
   processes and reasoning, including charts! They reached out to Tesla
   with questions (with a list of what was asked), but the company refused
   to comment. [50]It’s worth checking out.
