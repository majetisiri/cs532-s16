   Before beginning this article, I’d like to let everyone know that I am
   not a conspiracy theorist. I don’t know if what is happening with
   Chipotle is sabotage or random chance, but I’d like to explore both
   possibilities. I have to admit, I was pretty surprised when I heard
   there was an E. Coli outbreak at Chipotle. By the time it reached my
   region (the Mid-Atlantic), I felt that something was off, that it
   wasn’t just a coincidental outbreak. So I went out and had Chipotle for
   lunch. I had a suspicion that this outbreak wasn’t an unfortunate
   occurrence, and after diving into some research and information, I have
   to admit that I’m questioning the entire situation.

   Cue Beastie Boys. You know you love this song.

   IFRAME: [48]https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5rRZdiu1UE

   Listen, I’m not one for conspiracy theories. I don’t think the
   government is planning to enslave us all. I do think we landed on the
   moon. I don’t think ebola was some sort of coordinated outbreak. I do
   kind of maybe believe in aliens, but that’s just from watching too many
   episodes of Ancient Aliens .My point is, I’m not much for outlandish,
   outrageous theories. I’m not sure if this was a coincidence or if it
   was indeed an act of sabotage. My point in writing this is to shed some
   light on the situation and the reality that companies like Monsanto do
   participate in sketchy behavior and often attack people and
   organizations that threaten the GMO industry. Even with the outbreaks,
   I want to emphasize that Chipotle is a great company that deserves our
   support. I’m not saying that is definitely what happened, there’s no
   way for me to know. But I do intend to explore the potential.

   The idea that Chipotle could’ve been targeted by the biotech industry
   is neither outlandish nor outrageous. Earlier this year, [49]Chipotle
   announced they had removed all genetically modified organisms from
   their menu. In the weeks and months after, they were slammed by the
   media. The media backlash to this was so strong, you’d think they had
   just announced they were switching to child labor instead of non-GMO
   food. Despite the backlash, Chipotle saw increased sales and a soaring
   stock. By all means, this was a genius move for the company.

   Because of this, Chipotle became a huge threat to the biotech industry.
   Let’s explore some other threats to the industry that were factually
   sabotaged and not nearly as large, influential or financially
   profitable as Chipotle.

RACHEL PARENT

   Rachael Parent is a teenage non-GMO activist and the founder of
   [50]Kids Right To Know. At just 14-years-old, Rachel would travel, give
   speeches and promote GMO labeling. In documents released in a freedom
   of information request by US Right to Know,  it turns out that
   [51]Monsanto had been working with University of Florida professor,
   Kevin Folta to target Rachel Parent with plans to discredit her, her
   work and her website. Kevin Folta has been described as a mouthpiece
   for Monsanto, and with emails like this, it’s not hard to see why:

   “I’m glad to sign on to whatever you like, or write whatever you
   like….I’d be happy to write the op-ed on making decisions on facts,”
   Folta wrote in an email in October 2014 to Monsanto.

   Further emails revealed that Folta was asked to take on “14-yr old GMO
   Labeling activist Rachel Parent.” Nine days after that email was sent,
   Folta released a video stating,

   “So when I think about answering Rachel Parent, who’s the activist
   child – well, young woman – who’s running the website Kids Right to
   Know…The things I just adore about Rachel is that she’s clearly very
   articulate, clearly intelligent. The problem that I have is when Rachel
   starts to let non-scientific thinking really kind of cloud her final
   decision-making process.” (emphasis mine)

   If Monsanto wasn’t threatened by her, why would they need to hire Kevin
   Folta to personally attack her? Folta went on to come up with a counter
   website to Rachel’s and it was released that Monsanto had granted him
   at least $25,000.

   If they’re willing to attack and sabotage a teenage GMO activist – what
   makes anyone think they wouldn’t attack a multimillion dollar non-GMO
   chain restaurant?

DR. OZ

   Dr. Oz is a prominent, outspoken doctor with his own TV show that
   reaches millions. After airing an episode that suggested Monsanto’s
   RoundUp weedkiller could potentially cause cancer, he found himself at
   the center of an attack. Ten physicians, ranging from institutions like
   Stanford to University of North Carolina, wrote Columbia University
   urging them to fire Dr. Oz for promoting “quack” ideas and remedies.

   The media jumped on this, loving the opportunity to attack a doctor who
   would dare to promote any type of natural remedy. What the media failed
   to do, as it so often does, is its homework. Had they done it, they
   would have immediately recognized the fact that these doctors had
   strong ties to the GMO industry.

   Most prominent of the group, Dr. Miller, has long promoted genetically
   modified organisms and was even a part of the anti-GMO labeling
   campaign in California. Dr. Ross is the executive director of the
   American Council on Science and Health, an organization that regularly
   promotes the benefits and safety of GMOs. He was also convicted of
   Medicare fraud and spent time in federal prison.

   The agrochemical industry used these doctors to run a smear campaign,
   to try to ruin a man’s career.

                                 [INS: :INS]

   These are just two of thousands of incidences of Monsanto’s tactics.
   They[52] sue small farmers. They [53]defame scientists brave enough to
   publish their independent research (aka not funded by Monsanto). Other
   scientists [54]lose their jobs for not falsifying their research. What
   aren’t these people willing to do?

   Again, I’d like to reiterate that I am not a conspiracy theorist. But
   knowing this information and the lengths companies like Monsanto will
   go to to silence its detractors…it does make me seriously question the
   outbreaks at Chipotle.

THE OUTBREAK(S).

   During most E. coli outbreaks, the source is quickly identified and
   dealt with. More often than not, several companies will be affected.
   This is because to supply food to a massive chain like Chipotle, they
   need to source from producers on a massive scale, and these producers
   sell to many restaurants and chains across the US. Oddly enough, only
   Chipotle has been affected by these outbreaks.

   What many people fail to realize and the media is poorly reporting on,
   is that Chipotle hasn’t been affected by just one outbreak.  Even more
   puzzling, there have been several, with different viral strains.

   From Food Safety News,

   Seattle
   When: July
   Sickened: 5 people
   Culprit: E. coli O157:H7
   Source: Unknown

   [55]Simi Valley, CA
   When: August
   Sickened: At least 234
   Culprit: Norovirus
   Source: Unknown

   [56]Minnesota
   When: August and September
   Sickened: 64 people
   Culprit: Salmonella Newport
   Source: Tomatoes

   [57]CA, IL, MD, MN, NY, OH, OR, PA, WA
   When: Began Oct. 19
   Sickened: 52 people
   Culprit: E. coli O26
   Source: Unknown

   [58]Boston
   When: December
   Sickened: At least 136 people
   Culprit: Norovirus
   Source: Unknown

   So in total, Chipotle has been affected by two different strains of E.
   Coli, salmonella, and two norovirus outbreaks in different parts of the
   country.

   Even now, the sources of the outbreaks have not been identified. What
   has been identified is the type of outbreaks. The latest, the CDC has
   named a “[59]different, rare DNA fingerprint of Shiga toxin-producing
   E. coli.” This rare E. coli is not normally seen in foods. Chipotle
   performed hundreds of tests on their food and is still unable to
   identify the source.

THE RESULT.

   My intention in writing this is to highlight the possibility that this
   could be more than just an unfortunate coincidence. I don’t know if it
   is a coordinated effort, but knowing the above information I provided,
   I wouldn’t be shocked.  Unsurprisingly, Chipotle has taken a financial
   hit and their stock prices have gone down.

   My main intention in writing this is to urge people to still support
   Chipotle. They are doing amazing things. They were bravely the first
   chain restaurant to go GMO-free, opening themselves up to ridicule and
   backlash. Now that these outbreaks have happened, they are being bashed
   by the media yet again. Articles like “Was Chipotle too busy avoiding
   the fake dangers of GMOs to focus on actual food safety?” As if
   [60]tumors from GMO feed are fake.

   The media is dragging them through the mud. I encourage all of you to
   continue to support Chipotle. They have a commitment to healthy,
   sustainable food in a time when junk food, pesticides, sugar, trans fat
   and processed foods rule the American diet. They source from grass-fed
   farmers, they try to buy locally and they don’t use GMOs – a huge feat
   in itself. They have also taken extra measures to ensure food safety,

   “…we have partnered with Seattle-based [61]IEH Laboratories and
   Consulting Group, a preeminent food safety testing and consulting
   company. Led by company founder and CEO Dr. Mansour Samadpour, IEH is
   working directly with Chipotle’s Supply Chain and Operations
   departments to implement a set of industry-leading practices, including
   some changes to our previous protocols.”

                                 [INS: :INS]

   Keep in mind that Chipotle is still the healthiest fast food option.
   They have good intentions and are a great company. They’ve fallen on
   hard times but that is no reason to vilify them.
