   BirdEye intel reveals what consumers want from Chipotle this year

E. coli with a side of guacamole?

   It’s never comforting to hear your tacos may be seasoned with disease.
   Chipotle, the burrito chain built on serving “food with integrity”, has
   severely contaminated its reputation with [9]55 virus outbreaks in 11
   states across the US in 2015. Consumer sentiment reports imply hope of
   recuperation exists, but deeper insight into this customer feedback
   suggest a rough road to recovery ahead.

   Plummeting stock prices cannot be ignored, but more valuable than
   dollar signs could be the minds that determine them. [10]BirdEye is a
   next-generation business reputation and consumer experience platform
   that reimagines how customer feedback is used to acquire and retain
   connected customers. Our analysts used the [11]BirdEye platform, based
   on natural language processing with machine learning to capture and
   analyze online sentiment in 23 states, 50+ sites, 216 Chipotle
   locations and several primary competitors for 2015.

   In the first half of 2015, online ratings and sentiment proved as
   infectious as the virus itself. The following chart shows how
   nationwide online ratings for the Chipotle brand were afflicted by the
   series of outbreaks.

   The nation responds to virus outbreaks

   In the second half of Q4, customer sentiment soared. Assuming positive
   customer confidence implies loyal lunch breaks to a favorite
   restaurant, could this consumer sentiment trend be a profit indicator
   for a brand like Chipotle, or were the losses in early Q4 too severe to
   bounce back from in time? While overall sentiment has increased,
   certain locations have developed notoriety for their contamination
   incidents and local customers remain bitter.

Food for Thought: Best and Worst Chipotle Spots

   Nationwide Ratings by Location

   Simi Valley needs a bit of specialized intensive care, ranking a dismal
   #206 of all 216 branches. Want the best overall Chipotle experience?
   Head to Mankato, the top-rated location where customers are cheesin’
   hard and all injury seems to have healed.

   Another crucial factor to consider is sentiment towards major
   competitors. Unsatisfied Chipotle customers are still hungry for a
   quick bite, so where are they taking their grumbling tummies instead?

   Nationwide Ratings


   A glance at the [15]Birdeye competitive benchmarking tool suggests
   Chipotle is now in the clear despite an initial undignified tumble: in
   summer 2015, customers were about as satisfied with Chipotle as they
   were with Taco Bell. For a company that prides itself on serving fresh
   ingredients, lurking in the land of Dorito taco shells and glowing
   cheese is a far cry from success. Since then, however, Chipotle appears
   to be clambering back into favor with its target consumers, perhaps due
   to crisis control procedures implemented throughout the media including
   founder Steve Ells’ numerous [16]public promises of improvement.

   Consumer data indicates that customers have forgotten the E. coli
   scare; however, as in any relationship, earning forgiveness is a
   different story. While it seems the symptoms have subsided from
   Chipotle’s feverish financial plunge a few months ago, their rocky last
   quarter set them behind competitors and it will take specialized
   efforts to win back customers’ hearts. Aware of this, [17]Chipotle will
   close down all branches for a nationwide team-meeting on Monday,
   February 8 to discuss plans to improve in 2016.

   What should they focus on this year? America has specific priorities in
   mind for a speedy meal–according to BirdEye data, these are customer
   service and meat quality. Panera ranks highest for both, while
   Chipotle’s chicken is most frequently described as “burnt” or “raw”,
   and their service is almost equally reported as “great” and “terrible”.
    These drastic inconsistencies are likely to leave a foul aftertaste
   in the mouths and minds of customers.

   Chipotle’s increase in consumer sentiment is definitely encouraging,
   but to retain this happiness and achieve the stability of its
   competitors, the company still has much to prove. Unless Chipotle has
   plans of installing drive-thru, it seems both their chicken and service
   strategy should be simmered more cautiously.
