Crockpot Root Beer Barbecue Chicken Recipe | With Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ
Sauce

My first crockpot dinner!! It was super delicious!! I substituted: 8oz of Dr.
Pepper cherry for the root beer; used some garlic powder, and maple & brown
sugar baby rays bbq sauce. Cooked on high for 4 hrs (was cooked thoroughly at
3 hrs but the extra hr gave it that fall apart tenderness!) I didn't measure
out the bbq sauce either but heavily coated the bottom of the crockpot, put
chicken in, then used enough bbq sauce so that the chicken was covered. Also,
I added all ingredients at the start and let it cook together for the entire
time instead of adding at the end. This was a HUGE HIT on the 4th!!
