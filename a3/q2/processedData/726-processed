How the Media Spun Chipotle’s Outbreaks

   Chipotle One of the biggest stories to hit the food world in the past
   several months has been the outbreaks at the fast casual chain
   [20]Chipotle Mexican Grill. Last year, Chipotle had several instances
   of norovirus, salmonella, and e. coli outbreaks. Chipotle prides itself
   on serving local, organic, and non-GMO ingredients when available. So
   after the media heard about the outbreaks, they saw this as way to wage
   war on real food and say Chipotle’s sustainable practices are making
   people sick.

   The attack on Chipotle shouldn’t come as a surprise. With big ag paying
   millions of dollars to advertise, the media has a bias against small
   farms using old fashioned methods. This assault on family farms goes
   back decades. I’m reminded of how raw milk become demonized. People
   didn’t become sick from raw milk because the milk was unpasteurized,
   but because the dairies had become very unsanitary.

   At one of the Chipotle restaurants, 140 people were reported to have
   norovirus.  Norovirus is typically spread by employees not washing
   their hands.  In other words, norovirus could spread at a conventional
   restaurant too if the workers aren’t practicing proper hygiene.

   Another charge against Chipotle has been for not using chemical
   fertilizers.  No, I’m not kidding.  An argument has been made that
   fertilizers from animals are more likely to spread diseases, such as
   salmonella.  While this is true, it doesn’t mean that crops sprayed
   with manmade fertilizers can’t cause outbreaks. And we’ve seen many of
   those, from cantaloupe to peanuts to spinach. Again, similar to raw
   milk, cleanliness is important in all agriculture. Neither artificial
   fertilizers nor pasteurization can be prevent contamination.

   Chipotle GMO Farewell And then there’s the fact that Chipotle isn’t
   100% GMO-free despite saying so.  This is the cause of the third type
   of outbreaks — e. coli. There are two areas where Chipotle still uses
   genetically modified products.  One is the soft drinks that they serve,
   such as Coca Cola. The other is the majority of the locations still use
   meats that are given GMO feeds, namely corn. Cows eating corn, whether
   it’s genetically engineered or not, has been linked to e. coli
   outbreaks in beef.  This is why there have been so many e. coli
   instances at fast food restaurants that use factory farms as their
   suppliers.  It happened at McDonald’s back in 1982.  Jack-in-the-Box
   had one of the largest in 1993.  And it’s happened at Taco Bell
   repeatedly.

   In other words, the e. coli contaminations didn’t occur because
   Chipotle wanted to be more sustainable than other fast food chains, but
   because Chipotle still isn’t sustainable enough.

   Then some argue that Chipotle has been a victim of corporate sabotage.
    People have claimed that the biotech industry has planted the strains
   in hopes of villainizing non-GMO food.  Currently, this is nothing more
   than a rumor.  But while there is no evidence of big ag sabotage, there
   is evidence of the media attacking organic farming.  Now more than
   ever, we in the real food community need to stand up and tell the world
   why our methods are the way to go.
