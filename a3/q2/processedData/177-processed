Get Ready To Be Blitzed By Chipotle Ads Begging You To Come Back

   Profits at Chipotle are way down—as are customers. But now that it's
   been declared E. coli free and instituted new procedures, the burrito
   company is launching its biggest ad campaign ever.

   If you’ve noticed shorter lines at Chipotle following several pathogen
   outbreaks that sickened [47]some 350 people, it’s not your imagination.
   Sales at the company’s restaurants plummeted by 15% in the fourth
   quarter and overall revenue dropped 7%, the company [48]reported in its
   earnings today. Chipotle CEO Steve Ells called it the "most challenging
   period" in the chain’s history.

   On Monday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said that the
   Chipotle’s E.coli outbreak appeared to be over, but things still could
   get worse for the brand, which now has 2,010 locations. The company
   announced it was now subject to a broader criminal investigation by the
   U.S. Department of Justice that is subpoenaing company-wide food safety
   documents dating back to January 2013.

   Over recent months, the company has worked to improve its food safety
   system to reduce its future food safety risk to "as low to zero as
   possible." On a call with investors, Ells detailed steps including a
   DNA testing program for fresh produce and meats, central washing
   facilities for produce, new cooking and marinating procedures, internal
   restaurant audits, and crew training programs. In addition, a
   third-party will audit each restaurant every quarter, with half of
   managers’ performance bonuses tied to the scores they receive and the
   other half tied to how they "invite customers back" to their stores.
   Watch some of Chipotleʼs older ad campaigns, [50]like this one about
   factory farming and this one f[51]eaturing Willie Nelson covering
   Coldplay.

   Before the outbreak, Chipotle was [52]best known for its [53]strong
   sustainability-focused brand. "None of the changes affect our
   commitment to Food With Integrity," Ells said, noting it would
   [54]continue to focus on providing sustainable ingredients and local
   produce.

   To lure customers back, Chipotle—a company that has [55]never focused
   much on traditional advertising—is getting ready to roll out the
   biggest advertising campaign in its history starting next week. The
   slate of outdoor, radio, TV, digital, and print ads over the next few
   months won’t, however, mention foodborne illness or food safety. The
   company is also launching its largest-ever direct marketing campaign at
   the same time.

   Who Will?

   One thing that is concerning is that the CDCʼs investigation wasn’t
   able to determine the source of the 11-state E.coli outbreak. Elaine
   Scallan, a food safety expert at the Colorado School of Public Health
   at the University of Colorado’s Anschutz Medical Campus, says that is
   common in restaurants that serve the same ingredients in many dishes.
   She notes that, compared to supermarkets, the restaurant and fast food
   industry is generally less stringent about tracing where each
   ingredient goes. Chipotle CEO Monty Moran said that Chipotle would be
   implementing a real-time, bar coded food tracing system for each
   ingredient in its system.

   Will customers come back to Chipotle? Predicting the long-term impact
   on a business after a high-profile outbreak can be difficult. "Some
   businesses fail, but some well-branded foods continue," says Scallan.
   "Maybe they see a dent in profits and sales for awhile, but I think
   there’s a good chance that they’ll come out the other and, hopefully
   having learned a lot of lessons about improving their food safety
   system."
