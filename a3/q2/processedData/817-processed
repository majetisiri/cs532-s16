Why Electric Cars Are Ditching AM Radio

   Electric cars may be energy efficient Earth-saving futuremobiles, but
   their rise could also have a strange unintended consequence: killing
   off the oldest form of radio.

   Two popular electric cars, the BMW i3 and Tesla Model X, are ditching
   terrestrial AM radio because electromagnetic noise from the electric
   motor interferes with the broadcast reception, causing static, as the
   blog [41]Music 3.0 recently pointed out.

   Electronics have always been a source of AM radio static, and electric
   motors are no exception. EVs are powered by a rechargeable battery,
   electric motor, and a frequency converter that controls how much power
   the car's electrical motors put out by turning [42]voltage on and off
   thousands of times a second, basically chopping up energy. This process
   causes electromagnetic interference that gets picked up by the radio.

   AM radio has always been more susceptible to static than its partner on
   the dial. "AM" stands for amplitude modulation, which means the height
   of the radio waves are varied over time to encode the information,
   versus “FM,” frequency modulation, which varies their speed. Since
   amplitude, not frequency, is affected by electrical noise emitted by
   gadgets like smartphones, TVs, computers, even vacuum cleaners and
   hairdryers, AM signals are prone to distortion and crackling.

   That crackle apparently just doesn’t fly with luxury auto brands. BMW
   spokesperson Rebecca Kiehne told me, "Electric motors cause
   interference on AM which is why BMW decided to remove this option.
   While it could be offered, BMW's performance standards are very high
   and we don't offer a product that meets less than those high
   standards."

   But while BMW disabled AM radio in the i3 because the company was
   worried customers would complain about the poor sound quality, some
   customers have instead taken to complaining about the lack of AM radio.
   Consumers took to forums to bemoan the omission, a few even saying they
   wouldn’t buy an i3 without it. One BMW owner [43]commented, “I plan to
   drag out my portable AM radio and leave it in the car.” Some owners are
   [44]hacking the car to get AM radio back.

   Meanwhile, the [45]new Tesla Model X also [46]dropped terrestrial AM
   radio from its [47]infotainment dashboard—a change from the Model S.
   Instead, you can get most AM stations via internet radio if you go menu
   diving through TuneIn, a service that aggregates internet radio and
   traditional AM/FM stations and is the [48]standard radio option in
   Tesla cars.

   “AM radio stations are accessible through our internet radio service in
   Model X. Because AM audio quality can be very poor, we offer internet
   radio to give our customers considerably better sound quality and
   reception coverage,” a Tesla spokesperson told me over email.
   Apparently, finding the stations isn’t always easy though; there’s a
   [49]Tesla forum devoted to figuring out how to locate AM stations on
   the Model X.

   At this point you may be asking, who cares? Isn’t AM radio a dinosaur
   technology with one leg in the grave? Does anyone even listen to it?
   The answer is yes: about 3 million people listen to it every day, and
   five of the ten most popular radio stations in the US are AM radio.
   “This narrative that somehow AM radio is dying is silly,” Dennis
   Wharton, communications executive at the National Association of
   Broadcasters, told me.

   Despite the higher sound quality of the FM band and the ascent of
   satellite and internet radio, the medium of FDR’s fireside chats and
   Rush Limbaugh is still cemented in American culture. AM signals can
   travel further distances, making it popular for talk radio and local
   programs like weather and traffic reports or emergency response
   information. It’s also more affordable to get on, so is home to lots of
   niche stations like foreign language radio, college radio, or religious
   programs. “It’s a haven for minority radio stations as
   well—particularly Latino and Hispanic radio has moved a lot to AM radio
   in recent years,” said Wharton. Not to mention some major sports
   franchises still broadcast games, sometimes exclusively, on legacy AM
   stations that have been around forever and have fiercely loyal
   listeners.

   The [51]National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) is asking BMW to
   reconsider its decision to drop AM radio, and NAB’s California branch
   [52]has teamed up with engineers to devise a solutions to the static
   problem. A group of [53]engineers in Germany are also working on a
   prototype for minimizing interference by shielding the engine’s cabling
   and insulating the motor, at a price point that’s affordable for
   automakers.

   Cars and radio have always been inextricably linked: about [54]90
   percent of people listen to traditional radio over the airwaves (more
   than use the internet), and [55]40 percent of that listening happens in
   the car. So it’s worth raising an eyebrow if electric cars are zooming
   toward the future and leaving a historical technology behind.
