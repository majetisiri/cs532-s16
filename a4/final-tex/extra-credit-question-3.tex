\chapter{Extra-Credit Question 3}
\label{available-representation}

\textbf{Repeat question 1, but with your LinkedIn profile.}

\begin{itemize}
\item  To find the page rank for all the 10 URIs I used a free PR estimator on the web which is located at: \\
{\url{http://www.seocentro.com/tools/search-engines/pagerank.html}}. 
\item The URI and its page rank is summarized in the Table \ref{Table:q3table1}.
\item While finding the page rank for each URI I took a screenshot. The screenshits are in the Figures \ref{fig:q3fig1},  \ref{fig:q3fig2},  \ref{fig:q3fig3},  \ref{fig:q3fig4},  \ref{fig:q3fig5},  \ref{fig:q3fig6},  \ref{fig:q3fig7},  \ref{fig:q3fig8} \ref{fig:q3fig9},  \ref{fig:q3fig10}
\end{itemize}

Comparing the rankings in question 2 and 3 I observed that their is a lot of difference in rankings. The reason behind this difference is, when we rank the URIs based on TF, IDF and TFIDF, we look for the frequency of the term. But the PR estimator ranks the URIs based on the quality of the document and also the quantity of backlinks. Calculating pagerank based on frequency of the term is not a good idea because even a poor quality document with high query term frequency will be ranked high.
