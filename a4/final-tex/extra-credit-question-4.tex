\chapter{Extra-Credit Question 4}
\label{available-representation}

\textbf{Repeat question 2, but change ``followers'' to ``following''?  In other words, are the people I am following following more people?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Using the `userFollowerData' file generated in question 2 as input, I extracted the following \textunderscore count from the JSON structure and stored it in a file `followingCount'. This code is listed in Listing \ref{lst:q4code1}
\item I calculated the mean, median and standard deviation for the following count. This code is listed in Listing \ref{lst:q4code2}. The output of mean, median and standard deviation are given in Table \ref{Table:q4table1}

\begin{table}

\caption{Mean, Median and Standard Deviation of number of people followed by the people followed by `ohttic'}
\label{Table:q4table1}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
\hline
Key & Value \\ \hline

Mean & 45183.2 \\ \hline
Median & 4609.5 \\ \hline
Standard Deviation & 96280.5156542 \\ \hline

\end{tabular}

\end{table}

\item I created a graph with following count on y-axis and the friends themselves on x-axis including `ohttic'. The graph is summarized in Figure \ref{fig:q4fig2}.

\item From the calculated median value `4609.5' and following count of `ohttic' `1,923' we can say that `ohttic' have less following count than his friends.
